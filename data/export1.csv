These levers work only for good ideas, or those that have genuine merit, and before the idea reaches the streamed state.

They can help mature software engineering knowledge, as classifications constitute an organized structure of knowledge items. Till date, there have been few attempts at classifying in software engineering. In this research, we examine how useful classifications in software engineering are for advancing knowledge by trying to classify testing techniques. The paper presents a preliminary classification of a set of unit testing techniques. To obtain this classification, we enacted a generic process for developing useful software engineering classifications. The proposed classification has been proven useful for maturing knowledge about testing techniques, and therefore, SE, as it helps to: 1) provide a systematic description of the techniques, 2) understand testing techniques by studying the relationships among techniques (measured in terms of differences and similarities), 3) identify potentially useful techniques that do not yet exist by analyzing gaps in the classification, and 4) support practitioners in testing technique selection by matching technique characteristics to project characteristics.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2009.13","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4775907","Classification;software engineering;software testing;test design techniques;testing techniques;unit testing techniques.","Software engineering;Software testing;Diseases;Knowledge engineering;System testing;Chemical elements;Application software;Software design;Chemistry;Civil engineering","program testing;software engineering","software engineering knowledge;unit testing techniques;engineering classification;matching technique characteristic;project characteristic;software testing","","29","","31","","6 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An early step was to establish a baseline of graduate education by surveying 28 master's programs in software engineering. The survey was largely limited to US schools. Key findings showed that the universities viewed software engineering largely as a specialization of computer science, that faculty size is generally small with few dedicated professors, and that new master's programs continue to start despite the decrease in computer science majors over the past few years. We used the IEEE Computer Society's Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) to structure our analysis of the 28 curricula, focusing primarily on courses and topics required or semirequired of all students. (A course is semirequired if there is at least a 50 percent chance a student must take it.) Major findings show wide variation in the depth and breadth of SWEBOK coverage in required and semirequired courses, less than 40 percent of all programs requiring an introductory course on software engineering, and many universities having required and semirequired courses that are peripheral to SWEBOK.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2009.133","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5222804","software engineering;curriculum;Software Engineering Body of Knowledge;SWEBOK;computer science education","Software engineering;Taxonomy;Computer science;Aerospace engineering;Automotive engineering;Systems engineering and theory;Educational institutions;Educational programs;Radio access networks;Collaboration","computer science education;educational courses;software engineering","master degree;software engineering;university program;graduate education;computer science specialization;educational course","","11","","8","","25 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The traditional method based on model and code re-generating is not conducive to management and maintenance. Refactoring has given guidance to gradual evolution of object-oriented software. This paper presents a approach using refined use case to capture the requirement to modeling enterprise application, and using the refactoring mappings between requirement and models to effectively maintain model and other parts of the application, which helps to smooth the evolution process of enterprise applications.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5366899","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5366899","","Object oriented modeling;Application software;Chemical technology;Software engineering;Logic;Databases;Programming;Software testing;Software maintenance;Information science","object-oriented programming;program compilers;software engineering","evolving enterprise application;refined use case;refactoring mapping;software engineering;code regenerating;object-oriented software","","","","11","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moody","University of Twente , Enschede","IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","15 Dec 2009","2009","35","6","756","779","Visual notations form an integral part of the language of software engineering (SE). Yet historically, SE researchers and notation designers have ignored or undervalued issues of visual representation. In evaluating and comparing notations, details of visual syntax are rarely discussed. In designing notations, the majority of effort is spent on semantics, with graphical conventions largely an afterthought. Typically, no design rationale, scientific or otherwise, is provided for visual representation choices. While SE has developed mature methods for evaluating and designing semantics, it lacks equivalent methods for visual syntax. This paper defines a set of principles for designing cognitively effective visual notations: ones that are optimized for human communication and problem solving. Together these form a design theory, called the Physics of Notations as it focuses on the physical (perceptual) properties of notations rather than their logical (semantic) properties. The principles were synthesized from theory and empirical evidence from a wide range of fields and rest on an explicit theory of how visual notations communicate. They can be used to evaluate, compare, and improve existing visual notations as well as to construct new ones. The paper identifies serious design flaws in some of the leading SE notations, together with practical suggestions for improving them. It also showcases some examples of visual notation design excellence from SE and other fields.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2009.67","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5353439","Modeling;analysis;diagrams;communication;visualization;visual syntax;concrete syntax.","Software engineering;Humans;Visualization;Design optimization;Problem-solving;Physics;Concrete;Flowcharts;Unified modeling language;Computer industry","software engineering","visual notations;software engineering;visual representation;physics of notations;design flaws","","596","1","152","","15 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, we wish to investigate the consistency of process and the stability of outcomes. METHOD-We compare the results of two independent reviews undertaken with a common research question. RESULTS-The two reviews find similar answers to the research question, although the means of arriving at those answers vary.

Mature engineering industries are recognized by projects and products that are, to some extent, reproducible. Yet, reproducibility in software engineering (SE) has not been investigated thoroughly, despite the fact that lack of reproducibility has both practical and scientific consequences. We report a longitudinal multiple-case study of variations and reproducibility in software development, from bidding to deployment, on the basis of the same requirement specification. In a call for tender to 81 companies, 35 responded. Four of them developed the system independently. The firm price, planned schedule, and planned development process, had, respectively, ldquolow,rdquo ldquolow,rdquo and ldquomediumrdquo reproducibilities. The contractor's costs, actual lead time, and schedule overrun of the projects had, respectively, ldquomedium,rdquo ldquohigh,rdquo and ldquolowrdquo reproducibilities. The quality dimensions of the delivered products, reliability, usability, and maintainability had, respectively, ldquolow,rdquo ""high,rdquo and ldquolowrdquo reproducibilities. Moreover, variability for predictable reasons is also included in the notion of reproducibility. We found that the observed outcome of the four development projects matched our expectations, which were formulated partially on the basis of SE folklore.

For example, when designing a climate monitoring satellite, designers may want to use the minimal amount of computing hardware to reduce weight and cost while supporting the image processing algorithms running onboard. A key problem in these situations is that the hardware and software designs are locked in a tightly coupled cost-constrained producer/consumer relationship that makes it hard to find a good hardware/software design configuration. Search-based software engineering can be used to apply algorithmic techniques to automate the search for hardware/software designs that maximize the image processing accuracy while respecting cost constraints. This paper provides the following contributions to research on search-based software engineering: 1) We show how a cost-constrained producer/consumer problem can be modeled as a set of two multidimensional multiple-choice knapsack problems (MMKPs), 2) we present a polynomial-time search-based software engineering technique, called the Allocation-baSed Configuration Exploration Technique (ASCENT), for finding near optimal hardware/software codesign solutions, and 3) we present empirical results showing that ASCENT's solutions average over 95 percent of the optimal solution's value.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.77","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5539763","Algorithms;computer aided software engineering;optimization methods;distributed computing.","Software algorithms;Software design;Algorithm design and analysis;Hardware;Software engineering;Iterative algorithms;Costs;Image processing;Monitoring;Satellites","hardware-software codesign;knapsack problems;software engineering","ASCENT;hardware-software codesign;automated search algorithm;climate monitoring satellite;computing hardware;image processing algorithm;hardware/software design configuration;cost-constrained producer/consumer problem;multidimensional multiple choice knapsack problem;polynomial time search-based software engineering;allocation-based configuration exploration technique","","8","","34","","5 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper proposes StakeRare, a novel method that uses social networks and collaborative filtering to identify and prioritize requirements in large software projects. StakeRare identifies stakeholders and asks them to recommend other stakeholders and stakeholder roles, builds a social network with stakeholders as nodes and their recommendations as links, and prioritizes stakeholders using a variety of social network measures to determine their project influence. It then asks the stakeholders to rate an initial list of requirements, recommends other relevant requirements to them using collaborative filtering, and prioritizes their requirements using their ratings weighted by their project influence. StakeRare was evaluated by applying it to a software project for a 30,000-user system, and a substantial empirical study of requirements elicitation was conducted. Using the data collected from surveying and interviewing 87 stakeholders, the study demonstrated that StakeRare predicts stakeholder needs accurately and arrives at a more complete and accurately prioritized list of requirements compared to the existing method used in the project, taking only a fraction of the time.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.36","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5740931","Requirements/specifications;elicitation methods;requirements prioritization;experimentation;human factors;recommender systems;social network analysis;stakeholder analysis.","Social network services;Collaboration;Filtering;Software;Size measurement;Software engineering;Business","collaborative filtering;data acquisition;project management;recommender systems;social networking (online);software management","social network;collaborative filtering;requirement elicitation;software engineering;stakeholder;StakeRare;recommender system;software project;data collection","","85","","113","","5 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previous software engineering research has implied a nonlinear impact of schedule pressure on software development outcomes. Borrowing insights from organizational studies, we formalize the effects of budget and schedule pressure on software cycle time and effort as U-shaped functions. The research models were empirically tested with data from a 25 billion/year international technology firm, where estimation bias is consciously minimized and potential confounding variables are properly tracked. We found that controlling for software process, size, complexity, and conformance quality, budget pressure, a less researched construct, has significant U-shaped relationships with development cycle time and development effort. On the other hand, contrary to our prediction, schedule pressure did not display significant nonlinear impact on development outcomes. A further exploration of the sampled projects revealed that the involvement of clients in the software development might have ldquoerodedrdquo the potential benefits of schedule pressure. This study indicates the importance of budget pressure in software development. Meanwhile, it implies that achieving the potential positive effect of schedule pressure requires cooperation between clients and software development teams.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2009.18","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4815275","Cost estimation;time estimation;schedule and organizational issues;systems development.","Programming;Job shop scheduling;Software performance;Computer industry;Financial management;Software development management;Software engineering;Testing;Pressure control;Size control","budgeting;DP industry;project management;sampling methods;scheduling;software cost estimation;software development management;software metrics;software quality;statistical testing","budget pressure;schedule pressure;software development cycle time estimation;software development effort estimation;software industry;software development performance;software engineering research;nonlinear impact;organizational study;U-shaped function;empirical testing;international technology firm;potential confounding variable;software process control;software size control;software complexity control;software conformance quality control;sampled project management;potential positive effect;software development team management strategy;software cost estimation","","46","","74","","17 Apr 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the May/June 2004 IEEE Software special issue on return on investment (ROI), the author presented measurement results for the ROI of software process improvement (SPI). This article made three main contributions. First, provided a detailed overview of publications containing real-life measurement results from practical applications of SPI, in which the author measured the ROI. My study included 20 cases, with an average ROI of 7 and a median of 6.6. This indicates that SPI's net profit seems to be approximately US$7 for every dollar invested. However, I found no published cases in which SPI investments resulted in a measurable loss; furthermore, the ROI bandwidth was large (between 1.5 and 19). This indicates that the actual ROI of an SPI investment seems hard to really guarantee up front. Second, I showed that benefits are just as easy to quantify as costs. Cost measurements are always based on an agreement about how to measure and quantify costs. Such an agreement can also serve as the basis for measuring benefits. My article contained data from two real-life projects that had made such cost and benefit measurements and calculated ROI. Finally, I concluded that expressing ""value"" is crucial. Software engineering and its improvement are often major investments for organizations. Investments must be profitable. Because different people in different roles share one generic term for value-money, I recommended expressing any software engineering effort and its benefits in financial terms.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2009.120","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5222799","software process improvement;return on investment;value-based software engineering;Six Sigma;management commitment;benefit measurement","Reflection;Financial management;Investments;Software engineering;Software measurement;Computer science;Computer industry;Data analysis;Data engineering;Economic indicators","software cost estimation;software metrics;software process improvement","follow-up reflection;ROI software process improvement;value-based software engineering;SPI investment;cost measurement;software organization","","3","","9","","25 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The fragmented nature of these specifications can hinder validation as it is difficult to understand if the specifications for the various operations fit together well. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for automatically constructing abstractions in the form of behavior models from pre/postcondition-based specifications. Abstraction techniques have been used successfully for addressing the complexity of formal artifacts in software engineering; however, the focus has been, up to now, on abstractions for verification. Our aim is abstraction for validation and hence, different and novel trade-offs between precision and tractability are required. More specifically, in this paper, we define and study enabledness-preserving abstractions, that is, models in which concrete states are grouped according to the set of operations that they enable. The abstraction results in a finite model that is intuitive to validate and which facilitates tracing back to the specification for debugging. The paper also reports on the application of the approach to two industrial strength protocol specifications in which concerns were identified.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.98","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5639021","Requirements/specifications;validation;automated abstraction.","Validation;Software engineering;Object oriented modeling;Protocols;Buffer storage","formal specification;software engineering","automated abstractions;contract validation;software engineering;behavior models;postcondition based specifications;precondition based specifications;formal artifacts;industrial strength","","22","","38","","18 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

QoSMOS can be used to develop service-based systems that achieve their QoS requirements through dynamically adapting to changes in the system state, environment, and workload. QoSMOS service-based systems translate high-level QoS requirements specified by their administrators into probabilistic temporal logic formulae, which are then formally and automatically analyzed to identify and enforce optimal system configurations. The QoSMOS self-adaptation mechanism can handle reliability and performance-related QoS requirements, and can be integrated into newly developed solutions or legacy systems. The effectiveness and scalability of the approach are validated using simulations and a set of experiments based on an implementation of an adaptive service-based system for remote medical assistance.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.92","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5611553","Service-oriented software engineering;QoS management;QoS optimization;adaptive systems.","Quality of service;Markov processes;Probabilistic logic;Unified modeling language;Analytical models;Optimization;Scattering","health care;medical computing;optimisation;quality of service;software engineering","QoS management;optimization;service-based systems;software engineering;QoSMOS;remote medical assistance;health care","","185","1","102","","28 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is even more relevant as new threats and forms of attack are constantly being revealed, compromising the security of systems. This paper addresses this problem by presenting an attack injection methodology for the automatic discovery of vulnerabilities in software components. The proposed methodology, implemented in AJECT, follows an approach similar to hackers and security analysts to discover vulnerabilities in network-connected servers. AJECT uses a specification of the server's communication protocol and predefined test case generation algorithms to automatically create a large number of attacks. Then, while it injects these attacks through the network, it monitors the execution of the server in the target system and the responses returned to the clients. The observation of an unexpected behavior suggests the presence of a vulnerability that was triggered by some particular attack (or group of attacks). This attack can then be used to reproduce the anomaly and to assist the removal of the error. To assess the usefulness of this approach, several attack injection campaigns were performed with 16 publicly available POP and IMAP servers. The results show that AJECT could effectively be used to locate vulnerabilities, even on well-known servers tested throughout the years.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2009.91","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5374427","Testing and debugging;software engineering;test design;testing tools;experimental evaluation;fault injection;attack injection.","Network servers;Software testing;Protocols;Debugging;Application software;Computer networks;Computer hacking;Communication system security;Automatic testing;Software engineering","computer crime;software engineering","vulnerability discovery;attack injection;networked computer systems;software components;security analysts;hackers analysts;AJECT;IMAP servers;POP servers","","24","1","33","","8 Jan 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Focusing on model-based testing, this paper reports on a series of controlled experiments. It investigates the impact of state machine testing on fault detection in class clusters and its cost when compared with structural testing. Based on previous work showing this is a good compromise in terms of cost and effectiveness, this paper focuses on a specific state-based technique: the round-trip paths coverage criterion. Round-trip paths testing is compared to structural testing, and it is investigated whether they are complementary. Results show that even when a state machine models the behavior of the cluster under test as accurately as possible, no significant difference between the fault detection effectiveness of the two test strategies is observed, while the two test strategies are significantly more effective when combined by augmenting state machine testing with structural testing. A qualitative analysis also investigates the reasons why test techniques do not detect certain faults and how the cost of state machine testing can be brought down.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.32","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5416729","State-based software testing;structural testing;controlled experiments;state machines.","Object oriented modeling;Costs;Fault detection;Unified modeling language;System testing;Software testing;Automatic testing;Software engineering;Software design;Logic testing","fault tolerant computing;finite state machines;program testing;software engineering","state machine based testing;software engineering;model based techniques;software organizations;fault detection;round trip paths testing;structural testing","","46","","69","","18 Feb 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Results show that interactive evolutionary search, supported by software agents, appears highly promising. As an open system, search is steered jointly by designer preferences and software agents. Directly traceable to the design problem domain, a mass of useful and interesting class designs is arrived at which may be visualized by the designer with quantitative measures of structural integrity, such as design coupling and class cohesion.

Even if the composition does not change, its behavior may evolve over time and become incorrect. Such changes cannot be fully foreseen through prerelease validation, but impose a shift in the quality assessment activities. Provided functionality and quality of service must be continuously probed while the application executes, and the application itself must be able to take corrective actions to preserve its dependability and robustness. We propose the idea of self-supervising BPEL processes, that is, special-purpose compositions that assess their behavior and react through user-defined rules. Supervision consists of monitoring and recovery. The former checks the system's execution to see whether everything is proceeding as planned, while the latter attempts to fix any anomalies. The paper introduces two languages for defining monitoring and recovery and explains how to use them to enrich BPEL processes with self-supervision capabilities. Supervision is treated as a cross-cutting concern that is only blended at runtime, allowing different stakeholders to adopt different strategies with no impact on the actual business logic. The paper also presents a supervision-aware runtime framework for executing the enriched processes, and briefly discusses the results of in-lab experiments and of a first evaluation with industrial partners.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.37","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5432226","Software engineering;software/program verification;assertion checkers;assertion languages;performance;design tools and techniques;distributed/Internet-based software engineering tools and techniques.","Runtime;Monitoring;Robustness;Software engineering;Application software;Quality assessment;Quality of service;Logic;Software performance;Software tools","business process re-engineering;program verification;service-oriented architecture;Web services","self supervising BPEL process;quality assessment;stakeholder;business logic;supervision aware runtime framework;industrial partner;business process execution language","","73","","41","","18 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The aim of our empirical investigation is to test whether the usage of the Conallen notation supports comprehension and maintenance activities with significant benefits, and whether such benefits depend on developers ability and experience. This paper reports and discusses the results of a series of four experiments performed in different locations and with subjects possessing different experience-namely, undergraduate students, graduate students, and research associates-and different ability levels. The experiments aim at comparing performances of subjects in comprehension tasks where they have the source code complemented either by standard UML diagrams or by diagrams stereotyped using the Conallen notation. Results indicate that, although, in general, it is not possible to observe any significant benefit associated with the usage of stereotyped diagrams, the availability of stereotypes reduces the gap between subjects with low skill or experience and highly skilled or experienced subjects. Results suggest that organizations employing developers with low experience can achieve a significant performance improvement by adopting stereotyped UML diagrams for Web applications.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2009.69","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5332231","Documentation;maintenance;and enhancement;software engineering;software/software engineering.","Unified modeling language;Application software;Object oriented modeling;Software maintenance;Web pages;Software engineering;Computer Society;Computer architecture;Service oriented architecture;Testing","Internet;Unified Modeling Language","Web application comprehension tasks;UML stereotypes;source code;stereotyped diagrams","","52","","34","","13 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When testing from a finite state machine (FSM), it is easy to solve the oracle problem and so it has received relatively little attention for FSMs. However, if the system under test has physically distributed interfaces, called ports, then in distributed testing, we observe a local trace at each port and we compare the set of local traces with the set of allowed behaviors (global traces). This paper investigates the oracle problem for deterministic and nondeterministic FSMs and for two alternative definitions of conformance for distributed testing. We show that the oracle problem can be solved in polynomial time for the weaker notion of conformance (⊆w) but is NP-hard for the stronger notion of conformance (⊆), even if the FSM is deterministic. However, when testing from a deterministic FSM with controllable input sequences, the oracle problem can be solved in polynomial time and similar results hold for nondeterministic FSMs. Thus, in some cases, the oracle problem can be efficiently solved when using ⊆s and where this is not the case, we can use the decision procedure for ⊆w as a sound approximation.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.45","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5750006","Software engineering/software/program verification;software engineering/testing and debugging;systems and software;distributed systems;finite state machine;nondeterminism;test oracle;controllability;local observability.","Testing;Controllability;Observability;Polynomials;Software;Software engineering","distributed processing;finite state machines;polynomials;program testing","distributed testing;oracle problem;finite state machine;FSM;physically distributed interfaces;polynomial time;weaker notion;NP-hard problem;sound approximation;decision procedure","","24","","37","","15 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although research in software engineering largely seeks to improve the practices and products of software development, many practices are based upon codification of expert knowledge, often with little or no underpinning from objective empirical evidence. Software design patterns seek to codify expert knowledge to share experience about successful design structures. Objectives. To investigate how extensively the use of software design patterns has been subjected to empirical study and what evidence is available about how and when their use can provide an effective mechanism for knowledge transfer about design. Method. We conducted a systematic literature review in the form of a mapping study, searching the literature up to the end of 2009 to identify relevant primary studies about the use of the 23 patterns catalogued in the widely referenced book by the “Gang of Four.” These studies were then categorized according to the forms of study employed, the patterns that were studied, as well as the context within which the study took place. Results. Our searches identified 611 candidate papers. Applying our inclusion/exclusion criteria resulted in a final set of 10 papers that described 11 instances of “formal” experimental studies of object-oriented design patterns. We augmented our analysis by including seven “experience” reports that described application of patterns using less rigorous observational forms. We report and review the profiles of the empirical evidence for those patterns for which multiple studies exist. Conclusions. We could not identify firm support for any of the claims made for patterns in general, although there was some support for the usefulness of patterns in providing a framework for maintenance, and some qualitative indication that they do not help novices learn about design. For future studies we recommend that researchers use case studies that focus upon some key patterns, and seek to identify the impact that their use can have upon maintenance.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.79","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5975176","Design patterns;systematic literature review;empirical software engineering","Software engineering;Software design;Systematics;Search engines;Terminology;Maintenance engineering","object-oriented programming;software maintenance","software design patterns;software engineering;software development;design structures;knowledge transfer;Gang-of-Four;object-oriented design patterns","","46","","66","","4 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Objective: We investigate how the context of models, the independent variables used, and the modeling techniques applied influence the performance of fault prediction models. Method: We used a systematic literature review to identify 208 fault prediction studies published from January 2000 to December 2010. We synthesize the quantitative and qualitative results of 36 studies which report sufficient contextual and methodological information according to the criteria we develop and apply. Results: The models that perform well tend to be based on simple modeling techniques such as Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression. Combinations of independent variables have been used by models that perform well. Feature selection has been applied to these combinations when models are performing particularly well. Conclusion: The methodology used to build models seems to be influential to predictive performance. Although there are a set of fault prediction studies in which confidence is possible, more studies are needed that use a reliable methodology and which report their context, methodology, and performance comprehensively.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.103","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6035727","Systematic literature review;software fault prediction","Predictive models;Context modeling;Software testing;Data models;Systematics;Analytical models;Fault diagnosis","Bayes methods;regression analysis;software fault tolerance;software quality","systematic literature review;fault prediction performance;software engineering;cost reduction;software quality;independent variables;fault prediction models;contextual information;methodological information;simple modeling techniques;naive Bayes;logistic regression;feature selection;predictive performance;fault prediction study;reliable methodology","","462","","241","","6 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Though it is profitable to have variety at the beginning of a research field, after some time, the diversity of metamodels becomes an obstacle, for instance to the sharing of results between research groups. To reach consensus and unification of existing metamodels, metamodel-driven software language engineering can be applied. This paper illustrates an application of software language engineering in the agent-oriented software engineering research domain. Here, we introduce a relatively generic agent-oriented metamodel whose suitability for supporting modeling language development is demonstrated by evaluating it with respect to several existing methodology-specific metamodels. First, the metamodel is constructed by a combination of bottom-up and top-down analysis and best practice. The concepts thus obtained and their relationships are then evaluated by mapping to two agent-oriented metamodels: TAO and Islander. We then refine the metamodel by extending the comparisons with the metamodels implicit or explicit within five more extant agent-oriented approaches: Adelfe, PASSI, Gaia, INGENIAS, and Tropos. The resultant FAML metamodel is a potential candidate for future standardization as an important component for engineering an agent modeling language.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2009.34","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4967615","Modeling;metamodel;multiagent systems.","Software engineering;Australia;Application software;Multiagent systems;Management information systems;Best practices;Standardization;Software architecture;Natural languages","languages;multi-agent systems;software engineering","MAS development;metamodel;software language engineering;multiagent systems;FAML","","93","","72","","26 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As larger, more complex concurrent systems are being developed, this is made increasingly difficult. We propose here a general approach based on the analysis of specialized design models expressed in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) that uses a specifically designed genetic algorithm to detect concurrency problems. Though the current paper addresses deadlocks and starvation, we will show how the approach can be easily tailored to other concurrency issues. Our main motivations are 1) to devise solutions that are applicable in the context of the UML design of concurrent systems without requiring additional modeling and 2) to use a search technique to achieve scalable automation in terms of concurrency problem detection. To achieve the first objective, we show how all relevant concurrency information is extracted from systems' UML models that comply with the UML Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time and Embedded Systems (MARTE) profile. For the second objective, a tailored genetic algorithm is used to search for execution sequences exhibiting deadlock or starvation problems. Scalability in terms of problem detection is achieved by showing that the detection rates of our approach are, in general, high and are not strongly affected by large increases in the size of complex search spaces.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5661791","Search-based software engineering;MDD;deadlock;starvation;model analysis;concurrent systems;UML;MARTE;genetic algorithms.","Unified modeling language;Concurrent computing;System recovery;Analytical models;Real time systems;Computational modeling;Data mining","concurrency control;embedded systems;genetic algorithms;search problems;software engineering;Unified Modeling Language","UML-MARTE model analysis method;starvation;deadlocks;concurrency problems;design process;complex concurrent systems;specialized design models;Unified Modeling Language;genetic algorithm;UML design;search technique;scalable automation;concurrency problem detection;concurrency information;UML models;UML modeling and analysis;real-time systems;embedded systems;MARTE profile;execution sequences;complex search spaces","","14","","46","","10 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such specifications are collected in an intermediate model, called the Performance Context Model (PCM). The intermediate model is translated into a performance model which is subsequently evaluated. The paper is focused on the mapping from the PCM to the performance domain. More specifically, we adopt Petri nets as the performance domain, specifying a mapping process based on a compositional approach we have entirely implemented in the ArgoPerformance tool.

In this paper, we describe Nighthawk, a system which uses a genetic algorithm (GA) to find parameters for randomized unit testing that optimize test coverage. Designing GAs is somewhat of a black art. We therefore use a feature subset selection (FSS) tool to assess the size and content of the representations within the GA. Using that tool, we can reduce the size of the representation substantially while still achieving most of the coverage found using the full representation. Our reduced GA achieves almost the same results as the full system, but in only 10 percent of the time.

Given this backdrop, we present an empirical study in RE process assessment. Our aim was to investigate how stakeholder perceptions and process prescriptions can be combined during assessments to effectively inform RE process improvement. We first describe existing methods for RE process assessment and the role played by stakeholder perceptions and subjective judgments in the software engineering and management literature. We then present a method that combines perceptions and prescriptions in RE assessments together with an industrial case study in which the method was applied and evaluated over a three-year period at TelSoft. The data suggest that the combined method led to a comprehensive and rich assessment and it helped TelSoft consider RE as an important and integral part of the broader engineering context. This, in turn, led to improvements that combined plan-driven and adaptive principles for RE. Overall, the combined method helped TelSoft move from Level 1 to Level 2 in RE maturity, and the employees perceived the resulting engineering practices to be improved. Based on these results, we suggest that software managers and researchers combine stakeholder perceptions and process prescriptions as one way to effectively balance the specificity, comparability, and accuracy of software process assessments.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2009.33","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4967614","Process implementation and change;qualitative process analysis;requirements engineering process;software management;software process.","Software engineering;Computer industry;Programming;Engineering management;Software quality;Project management;Risk management;Educational institutions;Data engineering;Quality management","formal specification;formal verification;project management;software development management;software maintenance;software process improvement;software quality;statistical analysis;systems analysis","requirements engineering process assessment;industrial case study;software development;RE prescription model;software engineering;stakeholder perception;subjective judgment;empirical study;software RE process improvement;software project management;TelSoft;plan-driven principle;adaptive principle;software process change;qualitative process analysis","","22","","56","","26 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Understanding the nature of that relationship can facilitate various development decisions related to prioritization of quality assurance activities. Overall, the previous research only drew a general conclusion that there was a monotonically increasing relationship between module size and defect proneness. In this study, we analyzed class-level size and defect data in order to increase our understanding of this crucial relationship. In order to obtain validated and more generalizable results, we studied four large-scale object-oriented products, Mozilla, Cn3d, JBoss, and Eclipse. Our results consistently revealed a significant effect of size on defect proneness; however, contrary to common intuition, the size-defect relationship took a logarithmic form, indicating that smaller classes were proportionally more problematic than larger classes. Therefore, practitioners should consider giving higher priority to smaller modules when planning focused quality assurance activities with limited resources. For example, in Mozilla and Eclipse, an inspection strategy investing 80% of available resources on 100-LOC classes and the rest on 1,000-LOC classes would be more than twice as cost effective as the opposite strategy. These results should be immediately useful to guide focused quality assurance activities in large-scale software projects.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2008.90","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4693715","Software science;Product metrics;Planning for SQA and Measurement applied to SQA and Software Quality/SQA;Software Engineering;Software/Software Engin;Open-source software;Software science;Product metrics;Planning for SQA and Measurement applied to SQA and Software Quality/SQA;Software Engineering;Software/Software Engin;Open-source software","Open source software;Software quality;Size measurement;Inspection;Object oriented modeling;Predictive models;Quality assurance;Large-scale systems;Software measurement;Density measurement","object-oriented methods;project management;software management;software metrics;software quality","software modules;size-defect relationship;quality assurance activities;object-oriented products;Mozilla;Cn3d;JBoss;Eclipse;software projects;product metrics","","82","","60","","2 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We show that the state-density function accepts a continuous piecewise representation over a partition in DBM-shaped sub-domains. We then develop a closed-form symbolic calculus of state-density functions assuming that model transitions have expolynomial distributions. The calculus shows that within each sub-domain the state-density function is a multivariate expolynomial function and makes explicit how this form evolves through subsequent transitions. This enables an efficient implementation of the analysis process and provides the formal basis that supports introduction of an approximate analysis based on Bernstein Polynomials. The approximation attacks practical and theoretical limits in the applicability of stochastic state-classes, and devises a new approach to the analysis of non Markovian models, relying on approximations in the state space rather than in the structure of the model.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2008.101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4711059","Software Engineering;Tools;Validation;Software and System Safety;Software/Program Verification;Formal methods;Reliability;Automata;Parallelism and concurrency;Approximation;Markov processes;Renewal theory;Stochastic processes;Software Engineering;Tools;Validation;Software and System Safety;Software/Program Verification;Formal methods;Reliability;Automata;Parallelism and concurrency;Approximation;Markov processes;Renewal theory;Stochastic processes","Stochastic processes;Function approximation;State-space methods;Petri nets;Density functional theory;Calculus;Polynomials;Software safety;Timing;Encoding","calculus;concurrency control;Petri nets;polynomial approximation;polynomial matrices;program verification;state-space methods;statistical distributions;stochastic processes","difference bound matrix domain;nonMarkovian model analysis;concurrent nonexponential timer;stochastic time Petri net;state space;state probability density function;continuous piecewise representation;closed-form symbolic calculus;expolynomial distribution;multivariate expolynomial function;approximate analysis;Bernstein polynomial;quantitative evaluation;untimed model;timed software verification","","25","","39","","12 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our dynamic analysis uses the aliasing properties of objects to synthesize a set of roles; each role represents an abstract object state intended to be of interest to the developer. We allow the developer to customize the analysis to explore the object states and behavior of the program at multiple different and potentially complementary levels of abstraction. The analysis uses roles as the basis for three abstractions: role transition diagrams, which present the observed transitions between roles and the methods responsible for the transitions; role relationship diagrams, which present the observed referencing relationships between objects playing different roles; and enhanced method interfaces, which present the observed roles of method parameters. Together, these abstractions provide useful information about important object and data structure properties and how the actions of the program affect these properties. We have implemented the role analysis and have used this implementation to explore the behavior of several Java programs. Our experience indicates that, when combined with a powerful graphical user interface, roles are a useful abstraction for helping developers explore and understand the behavior of object-oriented programs.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2008.91","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4693716","Program understanding;roles;design recovery.;Requirements/Specifications;Design Tools and Techniques;Software Engineering;Software/Software Engineering;Testing and Debugging","Data structures;Computer Society;Java;Graphical user interfaces;Information analysis;Data mining","data structures;diagrams;graphical user interfaces;Java;object-oriented programming;reverse engineering","automatic extraction;heap reference property;object-oriented program;role transition diagram;enhanced method interface;data structure;Java program;graphical user interface;program understanding;role relationship diagram","","3","1","30","","2 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There has been a great deal of recent interest in search-based formulations of this problem in which module boundaries are identified by automated search, guided by a fitness function that captures the twin objectives of high cohesion and low coupling in a single-objective fitness function. This paper introduces two novel multi-objective formulations of the software module clustering problem, in which several different objectives (including cohesion and coupling) are represented separately. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the multi-objective approach, a set of experiments was performed on 17 real-world module clustering problems. The results of this empirical study provide strong evidence to support the claim that the multi-objective approach produces significantly better solutions than the existing single-objective approach.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.26","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5406532","SBSE;module clustering;multi-objective optimization;evolutionary computation.","Search problems;Computer science;Performance evaluation;Software engineering;Clustering algorithms;Computational intelligence;Testing;Educational institutions;Computer applications;Application software","optimisation;pattern clustering;search problems;software engineering","software module clustering;multi-objective search problem;program structure","","209","1","32","","5 Feb 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Twenty software professionals were randomly allocated to a Learning group or a Control group and instructed to estimate and complete the same five development tasks. Those in the Learning group but not those in the Control group were instructed to spend at least 30 minutes on identifying, analyzing, and summarizing their effort estimation and uncertainty assessment experience after completing each task. We found that the estimation accuracy and the realism of the uncertainty assessment were not better in the Learning group than in the Control group. A follow-up study with 83 software professionals was completed to better understand this lack of improvement from lessons-learned sessions. The follow-up study found that receiving feedback about other software professionals' estimation performance led to more realistic uncertainty assessments than receiving the same feedback of one's own estimates. Lessons-learned sessions, not only in estimation contexts, have to be carefully designed to avoid wasting resources on learning processes that stimulate rather than reduce learning biases.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2009.2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4752843","Cost estimation;process implementation and change;review and evaluation;software psychology.","Uncertainty;Yield estimation;Feedback;Programming;Software performance;Psychology;Software engineering;Computer industry;Acoustic reflection;Databases","feedback;learning systems;software engineering","lessons-learned sessions;effort estimation;uncertainty assessments;software development;IT-project failures;feedback;learning process","","41","","42","","19 Jan 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The development cost of a DSL should be modest compared to the cost of developing a general-purpose programming language. Reducing the implementation effort and providing reuse techniques are key aspects for DSL approaches to be really effective. In this paper, we present an approach to build embedded domain-specific languages applying the principles of model-driven engineering. On the basis of this approach, we will tackle reuse of DSLs by defining families of DSLs, addressing reuse both from the DSL developer and user point of views. A family of DSLs will be built up by composing several DSLs, so we will propose composition mechanisms for the abstract syntax, concrete syntax, and model transformation levels of a DSL's definition. Finally, we contribute a software framework to support our approach, and we illustrate the paper with a case study to demonstrate its practical applicability.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2009.14","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4782971","Domain-specific languages;model-driven development;families of DSLs;DSL composition.","Domain specific languages;DSL;Model driven engineering;Object oriented modeling;Costs;Computer languages;Concrete;Metamodeling;Proposals;Software engineering","computational linguistics;programming languages;software engineering","embedded domain-specific languages;model-driven engineering;programming language;abstract syntax;concrete syntax;model transformation levels","","25","","38","","13 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, they are difficult to write manually, and automatic mining techniques suffer from 90-99 percent false positive rates. To address this problem, we propose to augment a temporal-property miner by incorporating code quality metrics. We measure code quality by extracting additional information from the software engineering process and using information from code that is more likely to be correct, as well as code that is less likely to be correct. When used as a preprocessing step for an existing specification miner, our technique identifies which input is most indicative of correct program behavior, which allows off-the-shelf techniques to learn the same number of specifications using only 45 percent of their original input. As a novel inference technique, our approach has few false positives in practice (63 percent when balancing precision and recall, 3 percent when focused on precision), while still finding useful specifications (e.g., those that find many bugs) on over 1.5 million lines of code.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5680914","Specification mining;machine learning;software engineering;code metrics;program understanding.","Software measurement;Refactoring;Data mining;Maintenance engineering;Cloning;Optimization","data mining;formal specification;program debugging;program testing;software quality","specification mining;formal specifications;program testing;optimization;refactoring;documentation;debugging;repair;automatic mining techniques;temporal-property miner;code quality metrics;software engineering process","","20","","61","","6 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, existing middleware that supports the event-based programming paradigm is not well suited to supporting location-aware mobile applications in which highly mobile components come together dynamically to collaborate at some location. This paper presents a number of techniques including location-independent announcement and subscription coupled with location-dependent filtering and event delivery that can be used by event-based middleware to support such collaboration.

We conduct a case study of coordination in the IBM Rational Team Concert project, which consists of 151 developers over seven geographically distributed sites, and expect that high congruence leads to a high probability of successful builds. We examine this relationship by applying two congruence measurements: an unweighted congruence measure from previous literature, and a weighted measure that overcomes limitations of the existing measure. We discover that there is a relationship between socio-technical congruence and build success probability, but only for certain build types, and observe that in some situations, higher congruence actually leads to lower build success rates. We also observe that a large proportion of zero-congruence builds are successful, and that socio-technical gaps in successful builds are larger than gaps in failed builds. Analysis of the social and technical aspects in IBM Rational Team Concert allows us to discuss the effects of congruence on build success. Our findings provide implications with respect to the limits of applicability of socio-technical congruence and suggest further improvements of socio-technical congruence to study coordination.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.29","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5740929","Empirical software engineering;socio-technical congruence;coordination;awareness;software quality;integration.","Software;Weight measurement;Programming;Software measurement;Collaboration;Software engineering;Context","social aspects of automation;software development management","socio-technical congruence;software build success;software project;social coordination;congruence measurements;unweighted congruence measure;weighted measure","","67","1","54","","5 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, despite the large number of recent studies on the applicability of different search-based optimization approaches, there has been very little theoretical analysis of the types of testing problem for which these techniques are well suited. There are also few empirical studies that present results for larger programs. This paper presents a theoretical exploration of the most widely studied approach, the global search technique embodied by Genetic Algorithms. It also presents results from a large empirical study that compares the behavior of both global and local search-based optimization on real-world programs.

However, in the real world, words used to have semantic relationships, such as synonym, hyponymy and so on. Therefore, classification methods based on statistics do not conform to the fact and the classification results also do not satisfying. To draw this problem, there is a need to obtain characteristic semantic information by taking advantage of ontology. With the help of the features of ontology class hierarchical structure and property constraint, one can match the terms with domain ontology concepts and build up the concept vector space model. Using ontology method for text classification alone will lack scientific and stringency of the statistics. Taking all the above into consideration, this paper takes a combination of the two classification methods. Firstly, we choose the characteristics with statistics method and based on this, add in the ontology and form the concept vector space. Besides, we improve the KNN algorithm from two aspects. Finally, we implement a module for text classification of telecom domain. In the end, we make an analysis and comparison of the results of both statistics-only based (without improving the KNN algorithm) and the combination of two classification methods (with improved KNN).","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5363406","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5363406","","Text categorization;Classification algorithms;Ontologies;Statistics;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Niobium;Software engineering;Telecommunications;Probability","ontologies (artificial intelligence);statistical analysis;text analysis","text classification algorithm;ontology methods;statistical methods;concept vector space model;KNN algorithm","","1","","","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Correspondingly, the response time of an entire component-based application can be predicted from the execution durations of individual component services. These execution durations depend on the runtime behavior of a component which itself is influenced by three factors: the execution platform, the usage profile, and the component wiring. To cover all relevant combinations of these influencing factors, conventional prediction of response times requires repeated deployment and measurements of component services for all such combinations, incurring a substantial effort. This paper presents a novel comprehensive approach for reverse engineering and performance prediction of components. In it, genetic programming is utilized for reconstructing a behavior model from monitoring data, runtime bytecode counts, and static bytecode analysis. The resulting behavior model is parameterized over all three performance-influencing factors, which are specified separately. This results in significantly fewer measurements: The behavior model is reconstructed only once per component service, and one application-independent bytecode benchmark run is sufficient to characterize an execution platform. To predict the execution durations for a concrete platform, our approach combines the behavior model with platform-specific benchmarking results. We validate our approach by predicting the performance of a file sharing application.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.69","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5530323","Genetic search;genetic programming;reverse engineering;performance prediction;bytecode benchmarking.","Reverse engineering;Predictive models;Application software;Delay;Runtime;Software engineering;Wiring;Genetic programming;Monitoring;Concrete","genetic algorithms;object-oriented programming;reverse engineering;search problems;software performance evaluation","genetic search;reverse engineering;parametric behavior model;component based software engineering;genetic programming;runtime bytecode count;static bytecode analysis;application independent bytecode benchmark","","34","2","38","","29 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Finding and refinding these notes is a form of navigation that is integral to software maintenance. Although there is some tool support in modern development environments for authoring and navigating these comments, we have observed that these annotations often fail to remind and are sometimes difficult to find by the programmer. To address these shortcomings, we have designed a new approach for software navigation called tags for software engineering activities (TagSEA). TagSEA combines the notion of waypointing (a mechanism for marking locations in spatial navigation) with social tagging to support programmers in defining semantically rich annotations to source code comments. The tool provides support for creating, editing, navigating, and managing these annotations. We present the results from two empirical studies, where we observed and then analyzed how professional programmers used source code annotations to support their development activities over 24 months. Our findings indicate that the addition of semantic information to annotations can improve their value. We also provide suggestions on how annotation tools in general may be improved.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2009.15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4782972","Annotations;software navigation;software tagging;tags;software development tools.","Tagging;Navigation;Programming profession;Software maintenance;Software tools;Software engineering;Filters;Software development management;Maintenance engineering;Computer science","authoring systems;software maintenance","source code annotations;software maintenance;modern development environments;software navigation;software engineering activities;waypointing;social tagging;software development tools","","35","1","34","","13 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, a novel parallel simulated annealing search algorithm is applied to the real-time task allocation problem to find baseline solutions which require a minimal number of changes in order to meet the requirements of potential upgrade scenarios. Another simulated annealing-based search is used for finding a solution that is similar to an existing baseline when new requirements arise.

The VC offers the promise of automatically proving that a program or component is correct, where correctness is defined by program assertions. While several VC prototypes exist, all adopt a semantics for assertions that is unsound. This paper presents a consolidation of VC requirements analysis (RA) activities that, in particular, brought us to ask targeted VC customers what kind of semantics they wanted. Taking into account both practitioners' needs and current technological factors, we offer recovery of soundness through an adjusted definition of assertion validity that matches user expectations and can be implemented practically using current prover technology. For decades, there have been debates concerning the most appropriate semantics for program assertions. Our contribution here is unique in that we have applied fundamental software engineering techniques by asking primary stakeholders what they want and, based on this, proposed a means of efficiently realizing the semantics stakeholders want using standard tools and techniques. We describe how support for the new semantics has been added to ESC/Java2, one of the most fully developed VC prototypes.

In this paper, we classified the defects of nine industrial (C/C++) and 23 student (Java) code reviews, detecting 388 and 371 defects, respectively. First, we discovered that 75 percent of defects found during the review do not affect the visible functionality of the software. Instead, these defects improved software evolvability by making it easier to understand and modify. Second, we created a defect classification consisting of functional and evolvability defects. The evolvability defect classification is based on the defect types found in this study, but, for the functional defects, we studied and compared existing functional defect classifications. The classification can be useful for assigning code review roles, creating checklists, assessing software evolvability, and building software engineering tools. We conclude that, in addition to functional defects, code reviews find many evolvability defects and, thus, offer additional benefits over execution-based quality assurance methods that cannot detect evolvability defects. We suggest that code reviews may be most valuable for software products with long life cycles as the value of discovering evolvability defects in them is greater than for short life cycle systems.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2008.71","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4604671","Code inspections and walkthroughs;enhancement;extensibility;maintainability;restructuring.;Source code organization;Code documentation;Construction QA;Methods for SQA and V&V;Measurement applied to SQA and V&V;Code inspections and walkthroughs;Maintainability","Quality assurance;Inspection;Runtime;Java;Software tools;Software engineering;Software measurement;Software quality;Guidelines;Timing","pattern classification;software maintenance;software reviews","software functionality;software evolvability;defect classification;software engineering tools;execution-based quality assurance methods;software products","","76","","73","","22 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Workspace awareness seeks to provide users with information of relevant ongoing parallel changes occurring in private workspaces, thereby enabling the early detection and resolution of potential conflicts. The key approach is to unobtrusively inform developers of potential conflicts arising because of concurrent changes to the same file and dependency violations in ongoing parallel work. This paper describes our research goals, approach, and implementation of workspace awareness through Palantír and includes a comprehensive evaluation involving two laboratory experiments. We present both quantitative and qualitative results from the experiments, which demonstrate that the use of Palantír, as compared to not using Palantír 1) leads to both earlier detection and earlier resolution of a larger number of conflicts, 2) leaves fewer conflicts unresolved in the code base that was ultimately checked in, and 3) involves reasonable overhead. Furthermore, we report on interesting changes in users' behavior, especially how conflict resolution strategies changed among Palantír users.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.64","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5928359","Software engineering;computer-supported collaborative work;programmer workbench;configuration management","Monitoring;Measurement;Instant messaging;Computer architecture;Databases;Context;Laboratories","configuration management;groupware;parallel processing;software management","Palantír;development conflict early detection;parallel code changes;workspace awareness;dependency violations;laboratory experiments;conflict resolution strategies;software configuration management system;computer-supported collaborative work;software engineering","","38","1","55","","23 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Now there's a subject that brooks no ""loyal opposition,"" right? Standards are material provided by some software god, biblically significant, subject to no doubt? In recent years I've come to question all that.In 2006, my colleague Johann Rost wrote a guest Loyal Opposition column on the standard for requirements documents. He explained that at the conceptual level he understood the standard quite well, but at the implementation level he found it impossible to follow. I offered him sympathy, hosted his column here, and sort of forgot about it. Time passed. Another colleague, Barbara Kitchenham, was beginning to struggle with certain software standards. One standard gave ""inappropriate advice for measuring software engineering processes."" Another standard was ""not suitable for measuring the design quality of a software product."" Echoing Johann's concerns, Barbara commented that ""experienced designers will be able to construct a number of different interpretations of the standard, implying that [it] is not a standard at all."" Barbara pointed me at yet another critic of software standards, Magne Jorgensen. He noted that one standard for software quality ""requires quality measurement and at the same time admits that there are no (universally) accepted quality measures"".","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2009.126","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5222806","software engineering;software standards","Software standards;Environmental economics;Project management;Subscriptions;Industrial economics;Radio access networks;ISO standards;IEC standards;Software systems","software quality;software standards","software standard;requirements documents;software engineering process;design quality;software product;software quality;quality measurement","","","","7","","25 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Software metrics programs might rank among the all-time touchiest subjects in software development. Done well, a measurement program can prove an effective tool for keeping on top of development effort-especially for large, distributed projects. It can help developers feel that they have a fair and objective way of communicating their progress and getting resources allocated where they're needed most. An effective metrics program must address both products and processes. Product-related metrics can be tied to customer satisfaction. They often represent objectively verifiable properties such as the number of bugs or defects found in a product. Process metrics, include measures of effort and effectiveness and can give quick feedback about the status of defect containment, productivity, and other desirable properties at many points during development. However, instituting these metrics poses different challenges that the authors discussed and developed some best practice solutions. These include design measures with multiple stakeholders, build on measures that come naturally out of existing processes, and transparency.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2009.180","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5287018","Software engineering;software metrics","Best practices;Software metrics;Programming;Resource management;Customer satisfaction;Computer bugs;Feedback;Productivity","software metrics","software metrics programs;software development;product-related metrics;process metrics;stakeholder design solutions;measure building solutions;transparency solutions","","1","","11","","16 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Fortunately, Moore's law still holds, so chip makers use transistors to boost performance through parallelism in multicore and manycore processors. However, exploiting the full potential of these processors requires parallel programming. Thus, a large number of developers need to parallelize desktop applications, including browsers, business applications, media processing, and other domain-specific applications. This is likely to result in the largest rewrite of software in the history of the desktop. To be successful, systematic engineering principles must be applied to parallelize performance-critical applications and environments.

Joshua Kerievsky extended the metaphor to architecture and design. Technical debt is similar to financial debt: it supports quick development at the cost of compound interest to be paid later. The longer we wait to garden our design and code, the larger the amount of interest. Discussions of the metaphor have distinguished different types of technical debt and how and when to best pay them off. Most agree that, sooner or later, technical debt will come due. But is this assumption universally true? If it's better to pay interest, what factors influence the decision to service the debt?

However, the software entities that are to be reused to build an application, e.g., services, have seldom been developed to integrate and to cope with the application requirements. As a consequence, they present mismatch, which directly hampers their reusability and the possibility of composing them. Software Adaptation has become a hot topic as a nonintrusive solution to work mismatch out using corrective pieces named adaptors. However, adaptation is a complex issue, especially when behavioral interfaces, or conversations, are taken into account. In this paper, we present state-of-the-art techniques to generate adaptors given the description of reused entities' conversations and an abstract specification of the way mismatch can be solved. We use a process algebra to encode the adaptation problem, and propose on-the-fly exploration and reduction techniques to compute adaptor protocols. Our approach follows the model-driven engineering paradigm, applied to service-oriented computing as a representative field of composition-based software engineering. We take service description languages as inputs of the adaptation process and we implement adaptors as centralized service compositions, i.e., orchestrations. Our approach is completely tool supported.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.62","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5928357","Service composition;software adaptation;interfaces;protocols;mismatch;adaptation contracts;process algebra;on--the-fly generation;verification;tools","Adaptation model;Protocols;Contracts;Algebra;Semantics;Encoding;Computational modeling","formal specification;process algebra;protocols;service-oriented architecture;software reusability;specification languages","service protocol adaptation;process algebra;on-the-fly reduction techniques;composition;software entities;reusability;software adaptation;adaptors;reused entity conversations;abstract specification;on-the-fly exploration;model-driven engineering paradigm;service-oriented computing;composition-based software engineering;service description languages;centralized service compositions","","35","","65","","23 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To improve the quality of error-handling, we need to understand the problems and obstacles that developers face when designing and implementing exception-handling. In this paper, we present our research on understanding the viewpoint of developers-novices and experts-toward exception-handling. First, we conducted a study with novice developers in industry. The study results reveal that novices tend to ignore exceptions because of the complex nature of exception-handling. Then, we conducted a second study with experts in industry to understand their perspective on exception-handling. The study results show that, for experts, exception-handling is a crucial part in the development process. Experts also confirm the novices' approach of ignoring exception-handling and provide insights as to why novices do so. After analyzing the study data, we identified factors that influence experts' strategy selection process for handling exceptions and then built a model that represents a strategy selection process experts use to handle exceptions. Our model is based on interacting modules and fault scope. We conclude with some recommendations to help novices improve their understanding of exception-handling.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5383375","Exception handling;user study;software developers.","Software performance;Application software;Debugging;Data analysis;Software tools;Functional programming;Programming profession;Performance evaluation;Visualization","error handling;software engineering","exception handling design;error handling quality;software development process;expert strategy selection process","","30","","15","","15 Jan 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A first generation of Software Process Modeling Languages (SPMLs) appeared in the 1990s but failed to gain broad industrial support. Recently, however, a second generation of SPMLs has appeared, leveraging the strong industrial interest for modeling languages such as UML. In this paper, we propose a comparison of these UML-based SPMLs. While not exhaustive, this comparison concentrates on SPMLs most representative of the various alternative approaches, ranging from UML-based framework specializations to full-blown executable metamodeling approaches. To support the comparison of these various approaches, we propose a frame gathering a set of requirements for process modeling, such as semantic richness, modularity, executability, conformity to the UML standard, and formality. Beyond discussing the relative merits of these approaches, we also evaluate the overall suitability of these UML-based SPMLs for software process modeling. Finally, we discuss the impact of these approaches on the current state of the practice, and conclude with lessons we have learned in doing this comparison.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2009.85","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5593045","Metamodeling;process modeling and execution;software process modeling languages;UML.","Unified modeling language;Software;Object oriented modeling;Analytical models;Semantics;Programming;Computational modeling","software engineering;Unified Modeling Language","UML based language;software development process;software process modeling language;UML based SPML;metamodeling approach","","48","","78","","30 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Typically, resources in terms of power and memory are constrained. C is the most common programming language used to develop applications on very small embedded sensor devices. We claim that C does not provide efficient mechanisms to address the implicit asynchronous nature of sensor sampling. C applications for these devices suffer from a disruption in their control flow. In this paper, we present FlowTalk, a new object-oriented programming language aimed at making software development for wireless embedded sensor devices easier. FlowTalk is an object-oriented programming language in which dynamicity (e.g., object creation) has been traded for a reduction in memory consumption. The event model that traditionally comes from using sensors is adapted in FlowTalk with controlled disruption, a light-weight continuation mechanism. The essence of our model is to turn asynchronous long-latency operations into synchronous and blocking method calls. FlowTalk is built for TinyOS and can be used to develop applications that can fit in 4 KB of memory for a large number of wireless sensor devices.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.66","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5492692","Embedded systems;object-based programming.","Sampling methods;Object oriented modeling;Wireless sensor networks;Application software;Computer languages;Object oriented programming;Java;Biosensors;Automotive engineering;Embedded software","C language;embedded systems;intelligent sensors;object-oriented languages;object-oriented programming;software engineering;wireless sensor networks","FlowTalk;language support;wireless sensor networks;programming language;C language;embedded sensor devices;sensor sampling;object-oriented programming language;memory consumption;light-weight continuation mechanism;asynchronous long-latency operations;TinyOS;memory size 4 KByte","","1","","44","","28 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While for many program comprehension purposes, it is sufficient to model a single version of a system, there are types of information that can only be recovered when the history of a system is taken into account. Logical coupling, the implicit dependency between software artifacts that have been changed together, is an example of such information. Previous research has dealt with low-level couplings between files, leading to an explosion of the data to be analyzed, or has abstracted the logical couplings to the level of modules, leading to a loss of detailed information. In this paper, we present a visualization-based approach that integrates logical coupling information at different levels of abstraction. This facilitates an in-depth analysis of the logical couplings, and at the same time, leads to a characterization of a system's modules in terms of their logical coupling. The presented approach supports the retrospective analysis of a software system and maintenance activities such as restructuring and redocumentation. We illustrate retrospective analysis on two large open-source software systems.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2009.17","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4815274","Software evolution;software visualization;logical coupling.","Radar;Information analysis;Software systems;Information resources;System analysis and design;History;Explosions;Data analysis;Data visualization;Software maintenance","data visualisation;software engineering;systems re-engineering","evolution radar;software evolution analysis;software artifacts;visualization;logical coupling information;abstraction;system module;open source software system analysis","","54","","38","","17 Apr 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Initial studies of information flow analysis were performed by abstracting away from time and probability. It is already known that systems that are proven to be secure in a possibilistic framework may turn out to be insecure when time or probability is considered. Recently, work has been done in order to consider also aspects either of time or of probability, but not both. In this paper, we propose a general framework based on Probabilistic Timed Automata, where both probabilistic and timing covert channels can be studied. We define a Noninterference security property and a Nondeducibility on Composition security property, which allow expressing information flow in a timed and probabilistic setting. We then compare these properties with analogous ones defined in contexts where either time or probability or neither of them are taken into account. This permits a classification of the properties depending on their discerning power. As an application, we study a system with covert channels that we are able to discover by applying our techniques.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5383372","Probabilistic timed automata;multilevel security;information flow analysis;weak bisimulation.","Information analysis;Information security;Automata;Clocks;Multilevel systems;Timing;Communication system control;Performance analysis;Power system security;Control systems","data flow analysis;probabilistic automata;probability;security of data;software agents;software engineering","probability based information flow analysis;multilevel system;indirect unwanted information flow;covert channel;probabilistic timed automata;probabilistic covert channel;timing covert channel;noninterference security property;nondeducibility;composition security property","","9","","45","","15 Jan 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Planning of software releases and allocation of resources cannot be handled in isolation. A feature can be offered as part of a release only if all its necessary tasks are done before the given release date. We assume a given pool of human resources with different degrees of productivity to perform different types of tasks. To address the inherent difficulty of this process, we propose a two-phased optimization approach that combines the strength of two existing solution methods. The industrial applicability of the approach is primarily directed towards mature organizations having systematic development and measurement processes in place. The expected practical benefit of the planning method is to provide release plan solutions that achieve a better overall business value (e.g., expressed by the degree of stakeholder satisfaction) by better allocation of resources. Without ignoring the importance of the human expert in this process, the contributions of the paper are seen in making the overall process more objective and the resulting decisions more transparent.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2008.80","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4641940","Planning;Management;Planning;Management","Resource management;Humans;Productivity;Optimization methods;Constraint optimization;Integer linear programming;Genetic programming;Project management;Feedback;Companies","project management;resource allocation;software engineering;software management","optimized resource allocation;software release planning;incremental software development;software project management","","54","3","41","","10 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This analysis provides a way of linking two features of particular interest in software systems: first the microscopic distribution of defects within components and second the macroscopic distribution of component sizes in a typical system. The former has been studied extensively, but the latter much less so. This paper shows that subject to an external constraint that the total number of defects is fixed in an equilibrium system, commonly used defect models for individual components directly imply that the distribution of component sizes in such a system will obey a power-law Pareto distribution. The paper continues by analyzing a large number of mature systems of different total sizes, different implementation languages, and very different application areas, and demonstrates that the component sizes do indeed appear to obey the predicted power-law distribution. Some possible implications of this are explored.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2008.105","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4711063","Defects;macroscopic system behavior;component size distribution;Pareto.;General systems theory;Software science;Design concepts;Reliability;availability;and serviceability","Software systems;Power system modeling;Joining processes;Microscopy;Thermodynamics;Temperature distribution;Predictive models;Assembly systems;Software standards;Equations","Pareto distribution;software engineering;statistical mechanics","general software systems modeling;statistical mechanics;complex system;defects distribution;component sizes distribution;power-law Pareto distribution","","20","","15","","12 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To this end, we propose a detection and resolution sequence for different kinds of bad smells to simplify their detection and resolution. We highlight the necessity of managing bad smell resolution sequences with a motivating example, and recommend a suitable sequence for commonly occurring bad smells. We evaluate this recommendation on two nontrivial open source applications, and the evaluation results suggest that a significant reduction in effort ranging from 17.64 to 20 percent can be achieved when bad smells are detected and resolved using the proposed sequence.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5680918","Scheme;bad smell;software refactoring;effort;detection;schedule.","Refactoring;Feature extraction;Distance measurement;Scheduling","scheduling;software engineering","bad smell detection;bad smell resolution;software engineers;optimal sequence;resolution sequence;detection sequence;open source applications","","55","","54","","6 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed approach also recommends candidate identifiers built from high-level artifacts related to the source code under development and has been implemented as an Eclipse plug-in, called COde Comprehension Nurturant Using Traceability (COCONUT). The paper also reports on two controlled experiments performed with master's and bachelor's students. The goal of the experiments is to evaluate the quality of identifiers and comments (in terms of their consistency with high-level artifacts) in the source code produced when using or not using COCONUT.

One reason for this bias seems to be that the effort estimates produced by software developers are affected by information that has no relevance for the actual use of effort. We attempted to acquire a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms and the robustness of this type of estimation bias. For this purpose, we hired 374 software developers working in outsourcing companies to participate in a set of three experiments. The experiments examined the connection between estimation bias and developer dimensions: self-construal (how one sees oneself), thinking style, nationality, experience, skill, education, sex, and organizational role. We found that estimation bias was present along most of the studied dimensions. The most interesting finding may be that the estimation bias increased significantly with higher levels of interdependence, i.e., with stronger emphasis on connectedness, social context, and relationships. We propose that this connection may be enabled by an activation of one's self-construal when engaging in effort estimation, and a connection between a more interdependent self-construal and increased search for indirect messages, lower ability to ignore irrelevant context, and a stronger emphasis on socially desirable responses.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.40","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6193066","Effort estimation;estimation bias;cultural differences;software engineering.","Estimation;Software;Companies;Context;Programming;Outsourcing;Instruments","estimation theory;software management","software development estimation;interdependence role;project failures;project plans;outsourcing companies","","13","","48","","1 May 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing systems increase complexity due to conflicting interdependencies, but ISD patterns that reduce this complexity, such as those that employ bottom-up or concurrent consideration patterns, are best suited for coping with existing systems.

In fact, to cover a particular branch of the code, a sequence of previous function calls might be required to put the internal state in the appropriate configuration. Internal states are not only present in object-oriented software, but also in procedural software (e.g., static variables in C programs). In the literature, there are many techniques to test this type of software. However, to the best of our knowledge, the properties related to the choice of the length of these sequences have received only a little attention in the literature. In this paper, we analyze the role that the length plays in software testing, in particular branch coverage. We show that, on “difficult” software testing benchmarks, longer test sequences make their testing trivial. Hence, we argue that the choice of the length of the test sequences is very important in software testing.

Given properties of features as first-order logic formulas in Alloy, our approach uses SAT-based analysis to automatically generate test inputs for each product in a product line. To ensure soundness of generation, we introduce an automatic technique for mapping a formula that specifies a feature into a transformation that defines incremental refinement of test suites. Our experimental results using different data structure product lines show that an incremental approach can provide an order of magnitude speedup over conventional techniques. We also present a further optimization using dedicated integer constraint solvers for feature properties that introduce integer constraints, and show how to use a combination of solvers in tandem for solving Alloy formulas.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.30","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5456077","Software/program verification;testing and debugging;software engineering.","Software testing;Automatic testing;System testing;Computer bugs;Logic testing;Data structures;Software quality;Automatic logic units;Acoustic testing;Constraint optimization","computability;data structures;program testing;program verification","incremental test generation;software product lines;mechanical techniques;systematic testing;scope-bounded testing;specification-based approach;first-order logic formulas;SAT-based analysis;data structure product lines;dedicated integer constraint solvers;Alloy formulas;program verification","","49","","60","","29 Apr 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Here, we propose the application of different background theories and SMT solvers to the verification of embedded software written in ANSI-C in order to improve scalability and precision in a completely automatic way. We have modified and extended the encodings from previous SMT-based bounded model checkers to provide more accurate support for variables of finite bit width, bit-vector operations, arrays, structures, unions, and pointers. We have integrated the CVC3, Boolector, and Z3 solvers with the CBMC front-end and evaluated them using both standard software model checking benchmarks and typical embedded software applications from telecommunications, control systems, and medical devices.

For the near-term future, we can anticipate the appearance of systems with large numbers of CPU cores, but without matching increases in clock-speeds. We will describe a model checking strategy that can allow us to leverage this trend and that allows us to tackle significantly larger problem sizes than before.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5661793","Software engineering tools and techniques;logic model checking;distributed algorithms;software verification.","Memory management;Formal verification;Search problems;Computational modeling;Multicore processing;Data models;Parallel processing","formal verification;multiprocessing systems","swarm verification techniques;logic model checking tools;multicore system development;CPU cores","","49","","22","","10 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Being able to manage and control the evolution of services is therefore an important goal for the Service-Oriented paradigm. This work extends existing and widely adopted theories from software engineering, programming languages, service-oriented computing, and other related fields to provide the fundamental ingredients required to guarantee that spurious results and inconsistencies that may occur due to uncontrolled service changes are avoided. The paper provides a unifying theoretical framework for controlling the evolution of services that deals with structural, behavioral, and QoS level-induced service changes in a type-safe manner, ensuring correct versioning transitions so that previous clients can use a versioned service in a consistent manner.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.22","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5728828","Services engineering;service evolution;versioning;service compatibility.","XML;Guidelines;Protocols;Business;Availability;Quality of service;Software","service-oriented architecture;Web services","software service;service-oriented paradigm;software engineering;programming languages;service-oriented computing","","75","","55","","10 Mar 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Does Software Process Improvement Reduce the Severity of Defects? A Longitudinal Field Study","D. E. Harter; C. F. Kemerer; S. A.

Although the software engineering literature suggests that software process improvement can help to reduce software defects, the actual evidence is equivocal. For example, improved development processes may only remove the “easier” syntactical defects, while the more critical defects remain. Rigorous empirical analyses of these relationships have been very difficult to conduct due to the difficulties in collecting the appropriate data on real systems from industrial organizations. This field study analyzes a detailed data set consisting of 7,545 software defects that were collected on software projects completed at a major software firm. Our analyses reveal that higher levels of software process improvement significantly reduce the likelihood of high severity defects. In addition, we find that higher levels of process improvement are even more beneficial in reducing severe defects when the system developed is large or complex, but are less beneficial in development when requirements are ambiguous, unclear, or incomplete. Our findings reveal the benefits and limitations of software process improvement for the removal of severe defects and suggest where investments in improving development processes may have their greatest effects.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.63","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5928358","Software complexity;defect severity;requirements ambiguity;software process;CMM","Complexity theory;Production;Coordinate measuring machines;Testing;Software quality;Programming","program debugging;software process improvement","software process improvement;longitudinal field study;information systems;software defects;software engineering literature;syntactical defects;critical defects;severe defects","","29","","68","","23 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The analysis of the 466 responses revealed an information mismatch between what developers need and what users supply. Most developers consider steps to reproduce, stack traces, and test cases as helpful, which are, at the same time, most difficult to provide for users. Such insight is helpful for designing new bug tracking tools that guide users at collecting and providing more helpful information. Our CUEZILLA prototype is such a tool and measures the quality of new bug reports; it also recommends which elements should be added to improve the quality. We trained CUEZILLA on a sample of 289 bug reports, rated by developers as part of the survey. The participants of our survey also provided 175 comments on hurdles in reporting and resolving bugs. Based on these comments, we discuss several recommendations for better bug tracking systems, which should focus on engaging bug reporters, better tool support, and improved handling of bug duplicates.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.63","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5487527","Testing and debugging;distribution;maintenance;and enhancement;human factors;management;measurement.","Computer bugs;Programming;Prototypes;Software engineering;Information analysis;Software testing;Debugging;Software maintenance;Human factors;Engineering management","program debugging;program testing;software quality","software development;APACHE;ECLIPSE;MOZILLA;CUEZILLA prototype;bug tracking tools","","126","","66","","17 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Training a software quality model with only one software measurement and defect data set may not effectively encapsulate quality trends of the development organization. The inclusion of additional software projects during the training process can provide a cross-project perspective on software quality modeling and prediction. The genetic-programming-based approach includes three strategies for modeling with multiple software projects: Baseline Classifier, Validation Classifier, and Validation-and-Voting Classifier. The latter is shown to provide better generalization and more robust software quality models. This is based on a case study of software metrics and defect data from seven real-world systems. A second case study considers 17 different (nonevolutionary) machine learners for modeling with multiple software data sets. Both case studies use a similar majority-voting approach for predicting fault-proneness class of program modules. It is shown that the total cost of misclassification of the search-based software quality models is consistently lower than those of the non-search-based models. This study provides clear guidance to practitioners interested in exploiting their organization's software measurement data repositories for improved software quality modeling.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.51","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5467094","Genetic programming;optimization;software quality;defects;machine learning;software measurement.","Software quality;Software measurement;Predictive models;Software metrics;Electronic mail;Genetic programming;Robustness;Costs;Machine learning;Software engineering","genetic algorithms;software management;software metrics;software quality","evolutionary optimization;software quality modeling;multiple software project repository;genetic programming;baseline classifier;validation classifier;validation-and-voting classifier;robust software quality model;software metrics;machine learner;software data set;search-based software quality model;software measurement data repository","","78","","48","","20 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present an automated approach that limits fragility problems by providing mechanical assistance in pointcut maintenance. The approach is based on harnessing arbitrarily deep structural commonalities between program elements corresponding to join points selected by a pointcut. The extracted patterns are then applied to later versions to offer suggestions of new join points that may require inclusion. To illustrate that the motivation behind our proposal is well founded, we first empirically establish that join points captured by a single pointcut typically portray a significant amount of unique structural commonality by analyzing patterns extracted from 23 AspectJ programs. Then, we demonstrate the usefulness of our technique by rejuvenating pointcuts in multiple versions of three of these programs. The results show that our parameterized heuristic algorithm was able to accurately and automatically infer the majority of new join points in subsequent software versions that were not captured by the original pointcuts.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.21","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5710951","Software development environments;software maintenance;software tools.","Software;Fuels;Software engineering;Observers;Robustness;Programming;Proposals","aspect-oriented programming","pointcut rejuvenation;pointcut expression recovery;aspect-oriented software;pointcut fragility;aspect-oriented programming;pointcut maintenance;deep structural commonalities harnessing;program elements;join points;pattern analysis;AspectJ programs;parameterized heuristic algorithm","","3","","43","","10 Feb 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our analysis is based on data collected from two projects from two independent companies. Combined, our data set encompasses eight years of development activity involving 154 developers. The principal contribution of this study is the examination of the relative impact that syntactic, logical, and work dependencies have on the failure proneness of a software system. While all dependencies increase the fault proneness, the logical dependencies explained most of the variance in fault proneness, while workflow dependencies had more impact than syntactic dependencies. These results suggest that practices such as rearchitecting, guided by the network structure of logical dependencies, hold promise for reducing defects.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2009.42","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5166450","Distribution/maintenance/enhancement;metrics/measurement;organizational management and coordination;quality analysis and evaluation.","Software systems;Predictive models;Quality management;Software engineering;Humans;Software development management;Programming","software fault tolerance;software maintenance;software metrics;software quality","software dependencies;work dependencies;customer-reported software faults;quality analysis","","139","1","48","","17 Jul 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Even if engineers are willing to tolerate inconsistencies, they are better off knowing about their existence to avoid follow-on errors and unnecessary rework. However, current approaches do not detect or track inconsistencies fast enough. This paper presents an automated approach for detecting and tracking inconsistencies in real time (while the model changes). Engineers only need to define consistency rules-in any language-and our approach automatically identifies how model changes affect these consistency rules. It does this by observing the behavior of consistency rules to understand how they affect the model. The approach is quick, correct, scalable, fully automated, and easy to use as it does not require any special skills from the engineers using it. We evaluated the approach on 34 models with model sizes of up to 162,237 model elements and 24 types of consistency rules. Our empirical evaluation shows that our approach requires only 1.4 ms to reevaluate the consistency of the model after a change (on average); its performance is not noticeably affected by the model size and common consistency rules but only by the number of consistency rules, at the expense of a quite acceptable, linearly increasing memory consumption.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.38","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5432227","Design tools and techniques;design.","Software design;Feedback;Design engineering;Maintenance engineering;Best practices;Software engineering;Programming profession","formal verification;software maintenance","consistency rules;automatic inconsistency tracking;automatic inconsistency detection;empirical evaluation;memory consumption;software design model;consistency checkers","","68","","40","","18 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To do this, however, it is necessary to enhance the way in which the current generation of tools view metamodeling and support the representation of the multiple, ?ontological? classification levels that often exist in subject domains. State-of-the-art tools essentially allow users to describe the abstract and concrete syntaxes of a language in the form of metamodels and to make statements in that language in the form of models. These statements typically convey information in terms of types and instances in the domain (e.g., the classes and objects of UML), but not in terms of types of types (i.e., domain metaclasses), and types of types of types, and so on, across multiple classification levels. In essence, therefore, while they provide rich support for ?linguistic? metamodeling, the current generation of tools provides little if any built-in support for modeling ?ontological? classification across more than one type/instance level in the subject domain. In this paper, we describe a prototype implementation of a new kind of modeling infrastructure that, by providing built-in support for multiple ontological as well as linguistic classification levels, offers various advantages over existing language engineering approaches and tools. These include the ability to view a single model from the perspective of both a general-purpose and a domain-specific modeling language, the ability to define constraints across multiple ontological classification levels, and the ability to tie the rendering of model elements to ontological as well as linguistic types over multiple classification levels. After first outlining the key conceptual ingredients of this new infrastructure and presenting the main elements of our current realization, we show these benefits through two small examples.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2009.31","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4907005","Language engineering;metamodeling;multilevel modeling.","Unified modeling language;Ontologies;Metamodeling;Concrete;Design engineering;Software tools;Prototypes;DSL;Production facilities;Software engineering","ontologies (artificial intelligence);software tools;Unified Modeling Language","multilevel language engineering;model-driven development;linguistic metamodeling;ontological classification levels;domain-specific modeling language;UML","","51","","37","","2 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Aim: Prior work has reported that, given M estimation methods, no single method consistently outperforms all others. Perhaps rather than recommending one estimation method as best, it is wiser to generate estimates from ensembles of multiple estimation methods. Method: Nine learners were combined with 10 preprocessing options to generate 9 × 10 = 90 solo methods. These were applied to 20 datasets and evaluated using seven error measures. This identified the best n (in our case n = 13) solo methods that showed stable performance across multiple datasets and error measures. The top 2, 4, 8, and 13 solo methods were then combined to generate 12 multimethods, which were then compared to the solo methods. Results: 1) The top 10 (out of 12) multimethods significantly outperformed all 90 solo methods. 2) The error rates of the multimethods were significantly less than the solo methods. 3) The ranking of the best multimethod was remarkably stable. Conclusion: While there is no best single effort estimation method, there exist best combinations of such effort estimation methods.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6081882","Software cost estimation;ensemble;machine learning;regression trees;support vector machines;neural nets;analogy;k-NN","Costs;Software performance;Measurement uncertainty;Taxonomy;Machine learning;Regression tree analysis;Support vector machines;Neural networks","software development management","ensemble effort estimation;software effort estimation;single method;multiple estimation method;error measures","","124","","82","","15 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a methodology for detecting burstiness symptoms in multi-tier applications but, rather than identifying the root cause of burstiness, we incorporate this information into models for performance prediction. The modeling methodology is based on the index of dispersion of the service process at a server, which is inferred by observing the number of completions within the concatenated busy times of that server. The index of dispersion is used to derive a Markov-modulated process that captures burstiness and variability of the service process at each resource well and that allows us to define queueing network models for performance prediction. Experimental results and performance model predictions are in excellent agreement and argue for the effectiveness of the proposed methodology under both bursty and nonbursty workloads. Furthermore, we show that the methodology extends to modeling flash crowds that create burstiness in the stream of requests incoming to the application.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.87","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6311395","Capacity planning;multi-tier applications;bursty workload;bottleneck switch;index of dispersion","Servers;Indexes;Dispersion;Switches;Predictive models;Estimation","client-server systems;Markov processes;queueing theory;resource allocation;software architecture","multitier applications;resource usage patterns;workload patterns;enterprise applications;user performance degradation;burstiness symptom detection;burstiness root cause identification;performance prediction model;server busy times;Markov-modulated process;service process variability;queueing network models;nonbursty workloads;flash crowd model","","29","","25","","24 Sep 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Bristlecone applications have two components: a high-level organization specification that describes how the application's conceptual operations interact and a low-level operational specification that describes the sequence of instructions that comprise an individual conceptual operation. Bristlecone uses the high-level organization specification to recover the software system from an error to a consistent state and to reason how to safely continue the software system's execution after the error. We have implemented a compiler and runtime for Bristlecone. We have evaluated this implementation on three benchmark applications: a Web crawler, a Web server, and a multiroom chat server. We developed both a Bristlecone version and a Java version of each benchmark application. We used injected failures to evaluate the robustness of each version of the application. We found that the Bristlecone versions of the benchmark applications more successfully survived the injected failures. The Bristlecone compiler contains a static analysis that operates on the organization specification to generate a set of diagrams that graphically present the task interactions in the application.

It has been used as a basic tool in several scenarios such as service selection, service validation, and service composition. The importance of semantics is also widely recognized. Indeed, there are several solutions to the problem of providing semantics to web services, most of them relying on some form of Description Logic. This paper presents an integration of model checking and semantic reasoning technologies in an efficient way. This can be considered the first step toward the use of semantic model checking in problems of selection, validation, and composition. The approach relies on a representation of services at process level that is based on semantically annotated state transition systems (asts) and a representation of specifications based on a semantically annotated version of computation tree logic (anctl). This paper proves that the semantic model checking algorithm is sound and complete and can be accomplished in polynomial time.

This is a timely problem and of increasing importance with the advent of the SaaS model of service delivery. Therefore, in choosing the SaaS service to utilize, project managers must identify and evaluate the level of risk associated with each candidate. Trust is commonly assessed through reputation systems; however, existing systems rely on ratings provided by consumers. This raises numerous issues involving the subjectivity and unfairness of the service ratings. This paper describes a framework for reputation-aware software service selection and rating. A selection algorithm is devised for service recommendation, providing SaaS consumers with the best possible choices based on quality, cost, and trust. An automated rating model, based on the expectancy-disconfirmation theory from market science, is also defined to overcome feedback subjectivity issues. The proposed rating and selection models are validated through simulations, demonstrating that the system can effectively capture service behavior and recommend the best possible choices.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5383370","Software as a service (SaaS);software selection;service utility;review and rating;trust and reputation;risk management;SLA monitoring.","Software quality;Risk management;Software maintenance;Costs;Software performance;Project management;Feedback;Monitoring;Business;Computer industry","quality of service;risk management;software architecture;software quality;software selection","software service quality;selection time;project development;software provider;SaaS model;reputation-aware software service selection;automated rating model;expectancy-disconfirmation theory;software service trustworthiness","","79","2","30","","15 Jan 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Commonly, durations of transitions within stochastic π-calculus models follow an exponential law. The underlying dynamics of such models are expressed in terms of continuous-time Markov chains, which can then be efficiently simulated and model-checked. However, the exponential law comes with a huge variance, making it difficult to model systems with accurate temporal constraints. In this paper, a technique for tuning temporal features within the stochastic π-calculus is presented. This method relies on the introduction of a stochasticity absorption factor by replacing the exponential distribution with the Erlang distribution, which is a sum of exponential random variables. This paper presents a construction of the stochasticity absorption factor in the classical stochastic π-calculus with exponential rates. Tools for manipulating the stochasticity absorption factor and its link with timed intervals for firing transitions are also presented. Finally, the model-checking of such designed models is tackled by supporting the stochasticity absorption factor in a translation from the stochastic π-calculus to the probabilistic model checker PRISM.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.95","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5611556","Temporal parameters;\pi-calculus;model-checking;Markov processes;stochastic processes.","Stochastic processes;Exponential distribution;Random variables;Analytical models","exponential distribution;formal verification;pi calculus;stochastic processes","temporal feature tuning;stochastic π-calculus;complex dynamical system modeling;biochemical reactions;continuous-time Markov chains;stochasticity absorption factor;exponential distribution;Erlang distribution;exponential random variables;probabilistic model checker;PRISM","","2","","36","","28 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Reasoning about the Reliability of Diverse Two-Channel Systems in Which One Channel Is ""Possibly Perfect""","B. Littlewood; J. Rushby","City University, London; SRI International, Menlo Park","IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","24 Sep 2012","2012","38","5","1178","1194","This paper refines and extends an earlier one by the first author [1]. It considers the problem of reasoning about the reliability of fault-tolerant systems with two “channels” (i.e., components) of which one, A, because it is conventionally engineered and presumed to contain faults, supports only a claim of reliability, while the other, B, by virtue of extreme simplicity and extensive analysis, supports a plausible claim of “perfection.” We begin with the case where either channel can bring the system to a safe state. The reasoning about system probability of failure on demand (pfd) is divided into two steps. The first concerns aleatory uncertainty about 1) whether channel A will fail on a randomly selected demand and 2) whether channel B is imperfect. It is shown that, conditional upon knowing pA (the probability that A fails on a randomly selected demand) and pB (the probability that channel B is imperfect), a conservative bound on the probability that the system fails on a randomly selected demand is simply pA X pB. That is, there is conditional independence between the events “A fails” and “B is imperfect.” The second step of the reasoning involves epistemic uncertainty, represented by assessors' beliefs about the distribution of (pA, pB), and it is here that dependence may arise. However, we show that under quite plausible assumptions, a conservative bound on system pfd can be constructed from point estimates for just three parameters. We discuss the feasibility of establishing credible estimates for these parameters. We extend our analysis from faults of omission to those of commission, and then combine these to yield an analysis for monitored architectures of a kind proposed for aircraft.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.80","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5975177","Software reliability;software fault tolerance;program correctness;assurance case;software diversity","Uncertainty;Software;Phase frequency detector;Cognition;Software reliability;Safety","aircraft;probability;reasoning about programs;software fault tolerance;uncertainty handling","diverse two-channel system;fault tolerant system;reasoning about the reliability;aleatory uncertainty;randomly selected demand;conditional independence;epistemic uncertainty;assessors belief;PFD;aircraft;probability of failure on demand","","21","","47","","4 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To this end, we present CTL-FO+, an extension over computation tree logic that includes first-order quantification on message content in addition to temporal operators. We show how CTL-FO+ is adequate for expressing data-aware constraints, give a sound and complete model checking algorithm for CTL-FO+, and establish its complexity to be PSPACE-complete. A ""naive"" translation of CTL-FO+ into CTL leads to a serious exponential blowup of the problem that prevents existing validation tools to be used. We provide an alternate translation of CTL-FO+ into CTL, where the construction of the workflow model depends on the property to validate.

In proposed mechanism, the amount of bandwidth to provision for each per hop behavior (PHB) adjusts at regular intervals based on environment feedback. The result of multiple simulations presents using this method improves QoS in the term of loss rate, delay and throughput in comparison to static provisioning.

Due to the intractability of computing exact solutions for POMDPs the researchers in the literature are seeking approximation solutions. The approximation by value iterating over a finite set of belief points is know as grid-based method. This paper proposes a special interpolation scheme collecting reachable belief points to form the finite belief set. The approach is based on the observation that reachable beliefs are what we are really interested in other than those arbitrary ones.

The mathematical property of each qualitative concept was described by a group of digital characteristics. After color features which can reflect the changes of diseased rice seeds were extracted from images, a cloud classifier was developed to classify the mildewed seeds elastically on the basis of cloud generators which implemented mapping between qualitativeness and quantities. Compared with the current rigid classifying methods, the cloud classifier was in conformity with the real distribution of data and simulated human thinking in qualitative way.

The stability of aggregating behavior of the swarms system are verified by practical stability theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. Practical stability analysis and numerical simulations results further indicate that the individual members living in group during the course of coordinative motion can realize the mutual aggregating behavior, the motion of each individual member is a combination of the inter-individual interactions, meanwhile, which are also presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.

Each of them can ameliorate the status of packets which arrived at the destination in a certain extent, and at the same time to improve the carrying capacity with the network bandwidth. However, the packets will be lost frequently when the background flow has been jittered intensively, and that is not wanted to happen at the destination. In this paper, we design the new algorithm. This new algorithm considers the increased arrival rate, which has been produced by packet pairs in network, and this arrival rate will control the destination time interval. First, compare the packet pairs with the arrival gap value. We use this method to obtain the probability about the increased time interval at the destination by packet pairs accurately, and thus can calculation the network throughput value. Second, we can match the time interval with the increased arrival rate at the destination, and relaxation the time interval by anomalies of the arrival rate. And that can avoid the packets lost as much as possible. The experimental result shows that this new algorithm has an obvious advantage which could control the size of destination time interval and reduce the arrival rate, which is better than traditional transmission control algorithms.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5366674","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5366674","","Bandwidth;Educational institutions;Algorithm design and analysis;Size control;Time measurement;Inductors;Probability;Throughput;Interleaved codes;Uncertainty","telecommunication congestion control","transmission control algorithm;varying arrival rate;packet transmission control algorithm;load shedding;hop-to-hop choke packet;network congestion;network bandwidth capacity;arrival rate reduction;transmission control algorithms","","","","8","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Basic SVM of WSVM is equipped with confidence coefficient to its decision capacity, and these coefficients form weighted-max-wins decision rule. LAANN is based on an informative metric derived from the most discriminant directions that are revealed by SVM decision interfaces. It also adopts a weighted voting strategy to improve performance. Three strategies facilitate computational ease and adaptation: basic classifier is created in individually desired feature space, which is achieved by self-tuning hyper parameters adaptively; training set is reduced by a tuning support vector clustering (TSVC); and working set of LAANN is pre-specified.

Artificial neural networks could gather their knowledge by detecting the patterns and relationships in data and learn through experience, and could perform well for optimization and prediction in complex non-linear systems. Artificial neural networks have been widely used in many life areas, but have not been used to predict the genomic breeding values or animal phenotypes. In this paper, Back-Propagation artificial neural network with Variable Hidden Neurons was used to predict the genomic breeding values. The results showed that artificial neural network could predict the animal genotype value, whatever there were interaction effect or not between gene loci. The sample size for training artificial neural network model could affect the training speed obviously, the training speed were obviously slowed along with enlargement of number of hidden neurons. A good structure of Back-Propagation artificial neural network needs a big sample for training its parameters. In some what, the sample size for training prediction model probably was not an important factor for prediction stability of artificial neural network; but large sample trained neural network model was very useful for training a Back-Propagation artificial neural network model with a small prediction error.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5366246","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5366246","","Animals;Artificial neural networks;Neurons;Predictive models;Genomics;Bioinformatics;Analysis of variance;Data analysis;Genetics;Nonlinear distortion","backpropagation;biology computing;genetics;neural nets","sample size;animal phenotype value;back-propagation artificial neural network;variable hidden neurons;linear multivariate approaches;genetic data sets;artificial neural networks;complex non-linear systems;genomic breeding","","2","","9","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As one of service's nonfunctional components, quality of service (QoS) can be used as the criteria for service selection process and evaluation of composition results. However, so far there is no suitable method to estimate composition result and existing approaches on QoS-aware service composition don't concern the effect of composition logic on composition consequences. This paper presents an approach to optimize a QoS-aware service composition based on the logical structure. With our approach, a global optimization consequence can be attained by displacing the single service component in a composition process, which is according to the flexibility of service execution duration under parallel logic. Moreover some experimental results illustrate that the proposed approach works effectively.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5365231","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5365231","","Quality of service;Web services;Logic;Petroleum;Service oriented architecture;Aggregates;Concurrent computing;Software algorithms;Software systems;Simple object access protocol","optimisation;quality of service;Web services","QoS-aware service composition optimization;logical structure;Web service composition;quality of service;global optimization","","1","","8","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many intrusion detection methods focus on signature detection, where models are built to recognize known attacks. However, signature detection, limited by its nature, cannot detect novel attacks. New intrusion types, of which detection systems may not even be aware, are difficult to detect. Anomaly detection focuses on modeling the normal behavior and identifying significant deviations, which could be novel attacks. In this paper we present a clustering algorithm to identify outliers. It performs clustering on feature vectors collected from the network and can automatically detect new types of intrusions without need of manual classification of training data. Experimental results show that our system achieves a satisfactory intrusions detection rate while keeping the false positive rate reasonably low.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5363695","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5363695","","Intrusion detection;Event detection;Clustering algorithms;Internet;Educational institutions;Cities and towns;Pervasive computing;Computer science;Computer network management;Environmental management","computer network security;digital signatures;pattern clustering","network clustering;anomaly detection;intrusion detection methods;signature detection;clustering algorithm;data training classification","","5","","19","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unlike the conventional implementation methods, HVH is built via dividing the training dataset of K-classes into two comparable sub-sets of classes, which can consider the multi-classification as a decision-making table. The structure of HVH requires at most log2(K) binary SVMs, which is far less than that of conventional methods.

Another question is these RFCS schemes may lose useful build-in self detection information results in performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a twice dissimilar redundancy computer based roll-forward recovery scheme (TDCS) that can avoid the correlated faults and realize fault-tolerance, without extra process.

So the advantages of the client-server and conventional P2P architectures are combined in our new architecture. The multi-level P2P system is comprised of a wide area P2P network and multiple local area P2P networks. In such systems, media data are stored not only on data servers, but also on user nodes which can simultaneously supply data to peer nodes during receiving data and playing video. This architecture greatly enhances service capacity, efficiently reduces the burden of media data servers, reliably guarantees VOD QoS, and owns good scalability. A prototype multi-level P2P VOD system has been built and experiment results confirm the superiority of the new multi-level P2P architecture.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5363407","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5363407","","Network servers;Peer to peer computing;Scalability;Prototypes","client-server systems;local area networks;parallel architectures;peer-to-peer computing;video on demand;wide area networks","video-on-demand systems;multilevel P2P architecture;client-server architecture;P2P transmission;data sharing rule;wide area P2P network;multiple local area P2P networks","","","","7","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our results indicate that there is a typical endogenous problem between voluntary disclosure and information quality; the higher the reliability of company information, the higher level of voluntary disclosure of information, thus, voluntary disclosure level reflects information quality to a certain, and provides investors with a simple tool for identifying listed company information quality; however, the level of voluntary disclosure has negative effects on information quality, as shows that some companies with higher reliability information may make use of the trust of their investors. Further, we find that, the level of voluntary disclosure has far less influence on information quality than the opposite impact according to coefficient.

Creep course of rice gel mainly consisted of high elastic deformation and viscous flow deformation with very little instantaneous initial deformation. Rice gel has visco-elastic property, which can be easily stretched and recovered to some extent. The creep course includes two stages. The initial creep stage is mainly caused by high elastic deformation of macromolecular network, which fits the Voigt model well, while the late creep stage is resulted by viscous flow deformation of linear molecular, which fits the Burgers three-component model well.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5362822","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5362822","","Creep;Stress;Probes;Testing;Viscosity;Elasticity;Educational institutions;Food technology;Capacitive sensors;Deformable models","creep;elastic deformation;food products;gels;texture;viscoelasticity","creep model;rice gel;creep behavior;texture analyzer;visco-elastic properties;elastic deformation;viscous flow deformation;instantaneous initial deformation;macromolecular network","","","","23","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then, we restructure red-black algorithm to be a producer-consumer thread pipeline. Under this thread-level pipeline model, consumer threads can reuse the data that the former producers have fetched into the shared cache. Then the number of cache miss reduces. Our experiment results show the application performance under the thread-level pipeline parallel model achieves about 40% additional improvement on core 2. Furthermore, we propose a synchronization mechanism in hardware to support this model, and discuss the scalability of this parallel model.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5366040","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5366040","","Pipelines;Parallel processing;Yarn;Algorithm design and analysis;Performance analysis;Scalability;Programming profession;Delay;Switching systems;Systems engineering and theory","microprocessor chips;parallel architectures","chip multiprocessors;thread-level pipeline parallel model;multiple processors architecture;red-black algorithm;producer-consumer thread pipeline","","","","9","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the current methods of CEP for RFID application usually focus on centralized architecture, which can't support distributed RFID application. The centralized CEP also lacks of robustness and scalability because of single point failure or network break. In this paper, a distributed CEP architecture is proposed which spreads centralized CEP tasks load over multiple communicating stations over CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture). A high performance plan based distributed CEP algorithm is proposed which uses parallel method to improve performance.

The preprocessing methods include key point location, finger image segmentation and fingerprint region extraction. Firstly, the key points including fingertips and valley points, which are called key points, are located from the hand contour image. Secondly, the middle finger is cropped from the hand image based on the information of the key points' positions and the knuckle's texture near the finger root. Finally, the fingerprint is extracted from the middle finger through the first knuckle's texture. Because of the low resolution of the fingerprint images, linear projection methods such as Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) are used for fingerprint feature extraction. Experimental results on a database of 86 hands (10 impressions per hand) show that these approaches are effective.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5363092","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5363092","","Fingerprint recognition;Image matching;Digital cameras;Fingers;Data mining;Linear discriminant analysis;Biometrics;Image segmentation;Image resolution;Image analysis","feature extraction;fingerprint identification;image segmentation;principal component analysis","fingerprint image preprocessing;digital camera;biometric;key point location;finger image segmentation;fingerprint region extraction;linear projection methods;principle component analysis;linear discriminant analysis;fingerprint feature extraction","","3","","10","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By studying the methods proposed by other scholars, a mew method, ICA (independent component analysis) -LSSVM (least squares support vector machine) is proposed by this paper. The first step of this method is to apply ICA to LSSVM for feature extraction. By using ICA, the original higher dimensional inputs will be transformed into other lower dimensional features. These new features are then used as the inputs of LSSVM to solve the load forecasting problem. By learning and training, we use the data of this subset to get the solution and find interrelationship of input and output by the LSSVM. This method has the advantage of self adaptability to weaken the human factors in fixing weight index and better extensive capability than traditional methods. It also has better convergence ability and strong global search ability, which consumes less time than other methods. Practical examples are cited in this paper to illustrate the process.

Firstly, we use a two-layered background subtraction, which is based on both chromaticity and gradient, to extract human contours from the frame sequence captured by camera. This subtraction helps us remove shadows from foreground and get a good contour for recognition. Then we parameterize a human posture with a model called star skeleton. Each posture is represented as five vectors by this model. To classify every posture into a symbol, we trained a classifier by SVM with a set of exemplars. This classifier calculates a symbol according to the star skeleton. So it transfers the frame sequence into a symbol sequence. Finally, an action is recognized from the symbol sequence with a string matching. Our system can be regarded as a new way for interaction between human and computer. It achieves a high and stable recognition rate in complex environment, and the experimental results show the promising effectiveness.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5366107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5366107","","Robustness;Humans;Skeleton;Support vector machines;Biological system modeling;Smart cameras;Support vector machine classification;Data mining;Laboratories;Intelligent systems","cameras;human computer interaction;image recognition;string matching;support vector machines","robust human action recognition system;single camera;two layered background subtraction;chromaticity;gradient;human contours extraction;frame sequence;human posture parameterization;star skeleton;SVM;symbol sequence;string matching;human computer interaction","","2","","15","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, top level security requirement is always required in financial systems, where a good access control framework is necessary. Traditional role-based access control frameworks lack of control in data access granularity and often slow down the system, even though it provides an efficient access control model which can restrict users' operation according to their roles. They can hardly meet the requirements in large financial system. This article proposes and implements a Three-Layer Role-based Access Control framework (TL-RBAC) which can perfectly meet the requirements in large financial system. TL-RBAC implements access control in three layers: web pages, operations and data. Coarse-grained access control in web pages layer is used to filter anonymous attacks such as web scan and DoS attacks. Fine-grained access control in operations and data layers guarantee that the user cannot do operations and access data out of his privilege. Performance testing report of the system shows that TL-RBAC meets the performance requirement in terms of system throughput and time per operation.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5362682","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5362682","","Access control;Data security;Credit cards;Web pages;Filters;Throughput;System performance;Computer hacking;Educational institutions;Computer science","authorisation;financial data processing;Internet","role-based access control framework;financial Web system;credit card number;stock number;fund number;top level security requirement;data access granularity;access control model;three-layer role-based access control;coarse-grained access control;Web pages layer;anonymous attacks;Web scan;DoS attacks;fine-grained access control;data layers;system throughput","","4","1","8","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, a three-dimensional interactive storage laboratory system (TISLS) based on interactive virtual reality environment was built through taking the actual logistics lab as a background, which includes most useful modules such as teaching system, storage management teaching, sorting system teaching, RFID tally system and lab platform and so forth. The virtual logistics equipments are built by 3S software. These equipments are loaded to VimIPad and optimized. The files of the equipments are leaded into Java 3D scene via the loader interface. The interactive virtual assembly and the bidirectional drive between the virtual scene animation and the stocks are implemented by using the Java event-handling model, combined with the database technology. This method not only increased the modeling effective but also boosted up the verisimilitude of model. The instance indicates that the system is excellent in immersion and interaction.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5363664","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5363664","","Virtual reality;Education;Logistics;Java;Layout;Industrial engineering;Environmental management;Sorting;Radiofrequency identification;Assembly","computer aided instruction;computer animation;interactive systems;Java;laboratories;teaching;virtual reality languages","three-dimensional interactive storage laboratory system;experimental teaching;Industrial Engineering;logistics devices;interactive virtual reality environment;logistics lab;storage management teaching;sorting system teaching;teaching system;RFID tally system;virtual logistics equipments;3S software;VimIPad;Java 3D scene;loader interface;interactive virtual assembly;bidirectional drive;virtual scene animation;Java event-handling model;database technology;virtual reality modeling language","","","","2","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Different project trade-off preferences exist in different industries. Based on this we propose set of axioms in project risk management which reflect relationships between key project variables. The conceptual model we develop satisfies this basic set of axioms. We use Bayesian networks (BNs) to model project trade-off. The purpose is to provide a quantitative model for trade-off analysis in project risk management.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5364789","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5364789","","Bayesian methods;Project management;Costs;Risk management;Iron;Quality management;Risk analysis;Resource management;Crisis management;Computer science","belief networks;project management;risk management;software cost estimation;software management;software quality","project trade-off;Bayesian network;time-cost-quality triangle;project risk management;project variable","","5","","26","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the independence assumption is often not reasonable for processes of interest in many applications because the dynamics of the process product autocorrelation in the process observations. The presence of significant autocorrelation in the process observations can have a large impact on traditional control charts developed under the independence assumption. A method of monitoring little shifts in stationary autocorrelated process is discussed in this paper. At first, auto-regressive moving-average model is used to fit stationary autocorrelated process. Then, process autocorrelation can be removed by residual method, and exponentially weighted moving average charts are constructed to monitor little shifts of process mean and variance. Comparing with other methods, we can illustration that this EWMA residuals charts have better efficiency for stationary autocorrelated processes.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5362792","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5362792","","Monitoring;Autocorrelation;Control charts;Process control;Chemical industry;Technology management;Random variables;Sampling methods;White noise;Industrial control","correlation methods;moving average processes","EWMA;monitoring stationary autocorrelated process;independent random variables;independence assumption;product autocorrelation process observations;significant autocorrelation process;traditional control charts;monitoring little shifts;stationary autocorrelated process;process autocorrelation residual method;shift mean process;auto regressive moving average model","","","","11","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of them is how to determine a feasible path that satisfies a set of constraints while maintaining high utilization of network resources. Multi-constrained QoS routing algorithm finds a feasible route in network that satisfies multiple independent constraints. In general, multi-constrained path selection is a NP-complete problem that cannot be exactly solved in polynomial time. The NP-complete problem is converted into a multi-objective optimization problem with constraints, and optimizes multi-constraint QoS parameter respectively in this paper. A multiple constrained QoS routing algorithm is then proposed to generate a set of non-dominated optimal route based on the optimization principle of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (DTRA), which can attain a satisfied multi-constraint QoS parameter nondominates set based on dominating tree. The dominating tree preserves the necessary relationships among QoS routings, and reduces the comparisons among QoS routing distinctly. So the convergence performance is quick. The theoretic analysis and experiment results show that our proposed algorithm (DTRA) is effective for multi-constrained QoS routing, and can improve the performance of networks.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5366794","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5366794","","Quality of service;Routing;Constraint optimization;Evolutionary computation;NP-complete problem;Protocols;Convergence;Delay;Jitter;Polynomials","communication complexity;evolutionary computation;optimisation;quality of service;telecommunication network routing;trees (mathematics)","multiple constraint quality of service routing algorithm;dominating tree;network resources;network routing;NP-complete problem;multiconstrained path selection;multiobjective optimization problem;nondominated optimal routing;multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;multiconstraint QoS parameter","","1","","8","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then, simulated data and real data (i.e., GPS data) are used to test the method separately. The following conclusions are drawn from these tests: (1) Orthogonal wavelet transform and EMD method can better mitigate the random errors which hide in periodic signal; (2) After significantly mitigating the influence of multi-path and others errors by the new model, the accuracy of vertical component position for GPS dynamic deformation can reach the mm level.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5363240","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5363240","","Noise reduction;Global Positioning System;Wavelet coefficients;Wavelet transforms;Monitoring;Signal processing;Wavelet analysis;Data mining;Signal analysis;Filters","feature extraction;filtering theory;signal denoising;wavelet transforms","wavelet fusion method;empirical mode decomposition method;signal analysis method;signal denoising;orthogonal wavelet transform;GPS errors;noise filter;trend extraction model;EMD method;GPS dynamic deformation","","","","8","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But because of illumination variation or facial expression, it is difficult to detect human faces accurately and fast. In this paper, an infrared face detection based on real Adaboost algorithm and Cascade structure is implemented. With active infrared illumination, the problem caused by variation of illumination is almost solved, which makes the detection system more robust. Meanwhile, the combination of real Adaboost and Cascade structure pays more attention to the human faces which is more difficult to identify, making the detection quicker a lot. In the detection of video sequence, all human faces can be detected, and misdetection rarely appears. The average processing time on a windows XP, PIV 2.4 GHz PC is about 40 ms for a 640*480-pixel image. So the improved detection is real-time. In addition, experiment proves that the improved detection behaves better when there is variation of facial expression or a little degree leaning of human face. Obviously, the improved detection is more efficient and could be used widely.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5366152","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5366152","","Face detection;Infrared detectors;Lighting;Classification algorithms;Humans;Infrared imaging;Laboratories;Optical imaging;Displays;Boosting","face recognition;infrared imaging;learning (artificial intelligence)","multiuser face detection;infrared illumination;real Adaboost structure;Cascade structure;free stereoscopic display system;video sequence detection","","","","12","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We also compare turbo PPIC /decoding with turbo PIC/decoding which was previously discussed, which shows that Turbo PPIC /decoding is dominantly superior to Turbo PIC /decoding in performance.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5366331","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5366331","","Convolutional codes;Multiaccess communication;Iterative decoding;Multiuser detection;Interference cancellation;Multiple access interference;Feedback;Convolution;Computational modeling;Modulation coding","code division multiple access;convolutional codes;interference suppression;iterative decoding;spread spectrum communication;turbo codes","iterative partial PIC;convolutional coded multicarrier DS-CDMA;Turbo partial parallel interference cancellation;decoding;a priori LLR feedback;a posteriori LLR feedback;direct sequence code division multiple access","","","","9","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The standard genetic algorithm has poor local search ability, large amounts of calculation, and adaptability to large space. On the other hand, simplex method based on local linearization is usually lost in local minimum values. So a new method was put forward through a promoted simplex operator embedded into genetic algorithm and the strategy was adopted to keep the group of best individuals.

The longer the craft tree is, the more influence the craft tree will exert on the makespan, thus advancing the formula of impact degree. In terms of the impact degree, the craft tree can be classified into two sets: the first set and the second set. For the first set, the job is scheduled based on the priority schedule strategy whereas for the second set, the job is scheduled by adopting first fit insertion strategy on the basis of the scheduling results of the first set. This algorithm also takes into consideration the occurrence of emergencies by proposing the strategy of dynamic scheduling.

The non-rigid shape can be represented as a weighted combination of K rigid basis shapes. Since K denotes the number of basis shapes that can represent the shape sequence, it provides a measure of deformation degree of the shape sequence. K is computed from the tracked positions of a sequence of non-rigid shapes by using rank analysis method. It is well known that the uncertainty of tracked position depends on the underlying spatial intensity structure in the image, which has strong directionality. Hence, the factor of directional uncertainty is taken into account in our deformation degree estimation method. In order to cope with the missing data problem, ¿-ß-¿ filter-based visual tracking is proposed to track the motion of feature points between the consecutive image frames and recover the missing points. Experimental results from real image sequences demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5366653","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5366653","","Uncertainty;Image sequences;Shape measurement;Tracking;Cameras;Informatics;Image sequence analysis;Computer vision;Noise shaping;Statistics","image sequences","deformation degree estimation;monocular image sequence;shape sequences;nonrigid shapes;rank analysis method;spatial intensity structure;directional uncertainty;missing data problem;¿-ß-¿ filter-based visual tracking","","","","10","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main idea is that we normalize all the feature values of dataset before clustering. So all the features play the same important role in the clustering, which make the k-means balanced. There are three contributions to this paper. First the disadvantages of the standard K-means are illustrated in detail. Second we design the balance K-means algorithm which all the values of features are projected into a fix range, so it can take over the disadvantage of the standard K-means and.

We propose a heuristic method to isolate the larger state space into some smaller state spaces for decomposing learning task. During the learning process, after remove the state loops in these learned episodes, we find some states are critical for agent can reach goal state. These critical states have two characteristics: 1) they have high probability appeared in all these acyclic episodes; 2) they are the gates for agent can move from a part of state space enter another part of state space. These critical states are called as gate states. So when we block all these gate states, the original larger state space is isolated naturally into some smaller state spaces. Although we can not ensure the isolation is absolutely complete, because the isolation is based on the episodes have been learned. But this method indeed gives agent the capability to decompose its state space according to the knowledge it learned. The experiments on grid-world problem also show the isolation tend to be complete along with the increase of training episodes.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5362940","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5362940","","State-space methods;Machine learning;Humans;Information science;Face;Neural networks","learning (artificial intelligence);probability","heuristic method;state space isolation;reinforcement learning;acyclic episodes;gate states;grid-world problem;probability","","","","11","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The model and method can reasonably deal with value adopting problems of hybrid discrete variables in optimization design. Due to the morbidity problem of traditional penalty function dealing with the constraint conditions, the new method using Chaos variable to update the violating constraint solution individual is proposed for improving PSO.

CURD (clustering using references and density) is a fast clustering algorithm based on reference and density, which can discover clusters with arbitrary shape and has the linear times complexity. However, it still has some shortcomings such as: the efficiency to deal with the high-dimensional data is uncertain, the noise processing is not ideal, besides the number of the clustering results may not satisfy the requirement of the users. According to these deficiencies, this paper introduces a new method to propose the high-dimensional data with information entropy technology and quotient space theory. Additionally it disposes the noise date in two stages. Finally, some improvement are given on the step of sorting the reference points by quotient space theory to produce multi-level clustering results so as to meet the different needs of customers.

This claimed performance is significantly better than all other comparable algorithms, where the best known result by other algorithms achieves 1.503 k MMs only. However, neither the complexity analysis of the algorithm given by its original proposers nor that by other authors are correct. In this paper, we give a formal complexity analysis and show that the claimed performance is not true. We find that the actual computational complexity of the algorithm should be 1.556 k. This means that the best modular multiexponentiations algorithm based on canonical-sighed-digit technique is still not able to overcome the 1.5 k barrier.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5366300","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5366300","","Public key cryptography;Computer science;Arithmetic;Algorithm design and analysis;Computational complexity;Digital signatures;Identity-based encryption;Performance analysis;Hamming weight;Public key","computational complexity;cryptography;digital arithmetic","fast modular multiexponentiation algorithm;modular multiplications;formal complexity analysis;computational complexity;canonical-sighed-digit technique","","","","18","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose an encoding-based, sequential pattern-growth approach for efficient mining of sequential patterns, PSBE (PrefixSpan with Bit-Encoding), which can find local frequent item with little cost. In this approach, we encode the database with 0,1 bits, build encoded database, and use the framework of PrefixSpan to find out sequential patterns. We can improve the PrefixSpan by the property of encoding.

In practical applications, the nodes in the grid domain need to transact with other strange nodes to acquire the services provided by those nodes. Recently, trust has been recognized as an important factor for Grid security. And it is important for them to make a trust evaluation for those strange nodes before transactions, because some nodes are dishonest. Currently, the method to solve this problem is to establish an effective trust mechanism in grid domain based on reputation. However, there are still some disadvantages in existence in some cases, as the dynamicity of the grid environment, although it can be risk-averse to some extent. Like some malicious nodes contribute high trust value through numerous good interaction behaviors at first, and then change to attack. In view of those problems and disadvantages, this paper proposes a dynamic grid trust model based on recommendation credibility, called DyGridTrust (Dynamic Grid Trust Model). This model can distinguish honest and dishonest recommendation and adjust the weight of trust evaluation dynamically. In addition, this trust model is able to obtain the trust value more objectively, so as to enhance the security of the grid system. Finally, in this paper, those perspectives have been confirmed by simulations, which are developed by Matlab R2008a.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5363348","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5363348","","Mathematical model;Grid computing;Application software;Security;Large-scale systems;Computer networks;Internet;Decision making;Intelligent networks;IP networks","grid computing;security of data","dynamic trust model;recommendation credibility;grid domain;grid security;trust evaluation;grid environment;DyGridTrust;dynamic grid trust model","","5","","16","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The results indicated that the gas-phase flow field in 90° curved ducts with inclination angle was different from that without inclination angle. As the influence of inclination angle, the secondary flow was delayed and the circumfluence zone was decreased, which were help to improve the flow condition in 90° curved ducts. Additionally, the tangential velocity at the outlet of 90° curved ducts increased with the increasing inclination angle. It was implied that the particles could obtain strong centrifugal force and high separation efficiency. However, the pressure drop also increased with the increasing inclination angle and consequently it led to the energy loss of curved ducts. Hence, the inclination angle should be optimized.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5362616","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5362616","","Numerical simulation;Ducts;Fluid flow measurement;Velocity measurement;Analytical models;Power engineering and energy;Delay;Energy loss;Wire;Energy measurement","eddy currents;flow simulation;numerical analysis","large eddy simulation;numerical simulation;gas phase flow field;different inclination angle;secondary flow;tangential velocity","","","","7","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This balance is determined largely by the data and no further assumptions are necessary except that the bias terms are estimated sufficiently well. This principle has been tested on the ID magnetotelluric inverse problem with special emphasis on high-frequency magnetotelluric (MT) data. Simulations clearly demonstrate that the method provides a good balance between resolution and variance. Starting from a homogeneous half-space, the best solution is sought for a fixed set of singular values. The model variance is estimated from the sum of the inverse eigenvalues squared, up to a certain threshold, and the bias variance is estimated from the model projections on the remaining eigenvectors. By varying the threshold, the minimum of the MSE is found for an increasing number of fixed singular values until the number of active singular values becomes greater than or equal to the estimated number.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5362938","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5362938","","Inverse problems;Earth;Geology;Sun;Testing;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Radio control;Pollution measurement;Robustness;Parameter estimation","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;geophysics computing;inverse problems;magnetotellurics;mean square error methods;singular value decomposition","TSVD;regularization level;total mean-square error;standard model variance;bias variance;singular-value decomposition;ID magnetotelluric inverse problem;magnetotelluric data;eigenvalues;eigenvectors","","","","9","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence, relevance feedback has been adopted as a promising approach to improve the search performance. In this paper, we propose a novel idea of learning with historical relevance feedback log-data, and adopt a new methodology called ""Collaborative Image Retrieval"" (CIR). To effectively search the log data,we propose a novel semi-supervised distance metric learning technique, called ""Laplacian Regularized Metric Learning"" (LRML), for learning robust distance metrics for CIR. Different from previous methods, the proposed LRML method integrates both log data and unlabeled data information through an effective graph regularization framework. We show that reliable metrics can be learned from real log data even they may be noisy and limited at the beginning stage of a CIR system.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5366586","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5366586","","Semisupervised learning;Collaboration;Image retrieval;Feedback;Educational institutions;Euclidean distance;Collaborative software;Computer science;Laplace equations;Content based retrieval","content-based retrieval;image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);relevance feedback;software metrics","semi-supervised learning;collaborative image retrieval;content-based retrieval;Euclidean metric;relevance feedback;Laplacian regularized metric learning;graph regularization framework","","","","13","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This thesis proposes a new method of feature subset selection, which is based on discrete binary version of particle swarm optimization (BPSO) and overlap information entropy (OIE). This method does not depend on classifier. The main idea is: at first, a group of particles are generated randomly. The OIE between attribute set and class attribute is used as BPSO algorithm's fitness function, its size denotes the correlation degree between selected attribute set and class attribute. Then, feature subset is optimized by BPSO. Finally, feature subset, which has the largest OIE with class attribute, is selected as the optimal feature subset. Experimental results on Bio_Train dataset of KDDCUP2004 confirm that this method can find the optimal feature subset effectively and its classification results are not worse than all features' classification results.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5366590","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5366590","","Particle swarm optimization;Information entropy;Rough sets;Pattern recognition;Information analysis;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Computer science;Kernel;Optimization methods","entropy;particle swarm optimisation;pattern recognition","feature subset selection;binary particle swarm optimization;overlap information entropy;pattern recognition","","3","","9","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

According to the deadline of the new arriving task, a planning preemptive threshold of the planned task queue is established to avoid preempting the tasks whose planning start time exceeds the threshold unnecessarily. In this paper, a concept of urgency of tasks is brought forward. When the planned task's planning start time is earlier than the threshold, the new arrival task would preemptive the planned tasks by maxima urgency first strategy method, and it optimizes the scheduling efficiency among consecutive tasks.

In the present paper, a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA), which combines the conjugate gradient method (CGM) with GA, is proposed to improve the performance of GA for cable forces optimization in a CFST arch bridge. The advantages of GA in global optimization and CGM in local searching ability are both included in the HGA method.

With this attribute, the pixels are classified as contiguous and noncontiguous ones, and then, refined histograms distinguish the small changes of video content better than the original histograms between frames, and it allows fine distinctions that are similar to original histograms. With the evaluation of our experiments, this approach extracts summarization more efficiently and accurately.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5363959","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5363959","","Histograms;Colored noise;Pixel;Distributed computing;Image color analysis;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Video surveillance;Image reconstruction;Content based retrieval","feature extraction;image colour analysis;statistical distributions;video surveillance","key frame extraction method;color spatial distribution;distribution histograms;surveillance video;summarization extraction method;palpable spatial characteristic","","5","2","14","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Area information of the blobs is used to count the number of fish in one frame, and the average number of fish over all frames is then recorded.

The greedy heuristic algorithm firstly establishes a TIG (thread interaction graph) based on data dependence and communication overhead between each thread. On this basis the algorithm carries out two rounds of operation for TIG, in which the threads are assigned to processors in the first round and the threads are assigned to groups of shared cache cores within a processor in the second round respectively. The experiment results show that greedy heuristic algorithm can find near-optimum solutions in reasonable time and behaves better than random algorithm which widely applied in the current OS and compiler when the number of threads increases, since it can find solutions in much less than random algorithm.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5366341","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5366341","","Yarn;Scheduling algorithm;Processor scheduling;Heuristic algorithms;Optimal scheduling;Computer science;Computer architecture;Parallel processing;Parallel programming;Parallel languages","graph theory;greedy algorithms;parallel algorithms;parallel architectures;scheduling","thread scheduling algorithm;automatic parallelization algprithm;Intel multicore architecture;shared cache architecture;bus interconnection architecture;greedy heuristic algorithm;thread interaction graph;compiler;operating system;random algorithm","","1","","7","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It applies both global search strategy and local search strategy to ensure the searching breadth as well as the solution precision. It adds a local search process in the standard genetic algorithm. When the best individual of every generation is found, the algorithm performs local search in the neighborhood of the best individual to find local optimum. The Elite retention strategy is also used to have the searched results and the best individual substitute the worst or other individuals and directly enter into the operation of next generation.

Because of poor understanding of the mechanism and influence factors of rockburst, it is very difficult to give accurate prediction using conventional methods. A new model based on Gaussian process (GP), which is a probabilistic kernel machine leaning and has become a power tool for solving highly nonlinear problems, therefore, is proposed. At first, case histories of rockburst occurrence with the real records of rockburst intensity and influence factors of rockburst are collected and are taken as prior knowledge to be learned by GP binary classification machine learning tech, where, maximum tangential stress in surround rockmass, uniaxial compressive strength, tensile strength of rock, and rockburst tendency index of rock, which can reflect the internal and exterior conditions of rockburst occurrence nicely are suggested to be main influential factors of rockburst. Then, the nonlinear mapping relationship between rockburst intensity and its influence factors can be established easily by GP model. Finally, prediction for the novel conditions in deep mines can be obtained using the model. The new model is applied in prediction for rockburst intensity at practical projects in China, Norway and USSR. Results of case study show the model is feasible, effective and simple to implement for rockburst prediction.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5364984","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5364984","","Gaussian processes;Machine learning;Predictive models;Artificial neural networks;Support vector machines;Kernel;Tensile stress;Learning systems;Geology;History","compressive strength;disasters;fracture;Gaussian processes;geology;geotechnical engineering;learning (artificial intelligence);mining;rocks;tensile strength","rockburst prediction;Gaussian process;geological disaster;deep mines;probabilistic kernel machine leaning;rockburst occurrence;rockburst intensity;maximum tangential stress;rockmass;uniaxial compressive strength;tensile strength;rockburst tendency index;nonlinear mapping;GP model","","2","","10","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Accurate and timely diagnosis of the water production problem will significantly increase the success of the remedial actions taken. The traditional approaches in production data analysis by means of empirical techniques for proper diagnosis of water production mechanisms are still debatable. This paper presents a novel approach in water production problem identification using data mining techniques for production data analysis. The data used in this approach are water-oil ratio and some reservoir knowledge. New parameters used to identify two common types of water production mechanisms, i.e. water coning and channeling, are developed, and tree based ensemble classifiers are used for diagnosis. Our results demonstrate the applicability of this technique in successful diagnosis of water production problems.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5362732","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5362732","","Production;Petroleum;Water resources;Data analysis;Economic forecasting;Environmental economics;Fuel economy;Mathematics;Statistics;Costs","data mining;environmental factors;oil technology;production engineering computing;water","excess water production diagnosis;oil fields;ensemble classifiers;oil production;environmental issues;production data analysis;data mining;water-oil ratio;water coning;water channeling","","3","1","13","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Wavelet threshold de-noising techniques is an important method to reduce noise in signal process. In this paper a new wavelet threshold function is proposed for removing noise in signal, which is based on the conventional soft and hard threshold functions. Both quantities of signal to noise radio (SNR) and mean square error (MSE) are introduced to judge the de-noising effectiveness. Some precipitable water (PW) time series data are processed by combined use of the new threshold function with Kolmogorov entropy and neural network prediction which are used to judge the de-noising effectiveness. The study results show that the new threshold function proposed can overcome the shortcoming of the conventional soft and hard threshold functions to a certain degree and is efficient for signal de-noising.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5365819","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5365819","","Atmospheric waves;Noise reduction;Data processing;Degradation;Signal processing;Signal to noise ratio;Mean square error methods;Entropy;Neural networks;Signal denoising","entropy;interference suppression;mean square error methods;prediction theory;signal processing;time series;wavelet transforms","atmospheric observation data denoising;wavelet threshold function;data processing system;signal process noise reduction;signal to noise radio;mean square error;precipitable water time series data;Kolmogorov entropy;neural network prediction","","","","12","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To provide a high-quality service for users, it is extremely important to design and manage the quality of experience (QoE) appropriately. To do this, it is necessary to develop an objective quality-assessment method that estimates subjective quality of streaming media. We propose a no-reference quality-estimation model for monitoring the video quality of streaming media services. The proposed model is based on video subjective quality assessment experiments and takes into account the spatial and temporal concealment of human visual system and the characteristic that human visual system is more sensitive to the parts with worse distortion of a video sequence. The experimental results indicate that Pearson Cross-Correlation was larger than 0.9, and the evaluation error was smaller than the statistical uncertainty of the value of subjective quality. Therefore, the proposed model could be applied to effective design, implementation, and management of streaming media services.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5364020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5364020","","Streaming media;Humans;Visual system;Video compression;Quality assessment;Video sequences;Degradation;Codecs;Condition monitoring;Quadratic programming","estimation theory;image sequences;IP networks;multimedia systems;statistical analysis;video signal processing;video streaming","video quality-estimation model;streaming media services;human visual system;broadband IP networks;quality of experience;quality-assessment method;video subjective quality assessment;video sequence;Pearson cross-correlation;statistical uncertainty","","2","1","7","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then, seven moment invariants are extracted to be matched by the Euclidean distance. In order to solve the problem of high false rate in finger-vein recognition using the single-feature method and the equal weights fusion strategy, the matching scores are fused by the weighted average strategy, and the equal error rate (EER) is minimized to obtain the optimum weights. Finally, the fused matching score is used to make the final decision. Experiment results prove that our algorithm has high performance on recognition rate, which at least reduces 11% in EER compared with the single-feature method and the equal weights fusion strategy.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5366021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5366021","","Veins;Infrared imaging;Error analysis;Image recognition;Euclidean distance;Capacitance-voltage characteristics;Biometrics;Fingers;Educational institutions;Active contours","feature extraction;fingerprint identification;image fusion;image matching","finger-vein recognition;score level moment invariants fusion;infrared vein images;finger-vein pattern extraction;Euclidean distance;single-feature method;equal error rate","","13","","13","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It modifies the label information base (LIB), that is, increases two fields: the mobile node address and the time counter. When the mobile node performs handoff and registration, the message arrives a router every times, it will look up the modified LIB, whether the mobile node was registered or not to confirm the CR. The theoretical analysis shows that the performance of delay is the more obvious with the increase of the hops.

The orbit perturbation method to chaotic stranger attractor is proposed to solve the problems. It is proved that the systems keep chaotic after their parameters are overlaid by some chaotic variables. As a result, the run-course closes to the ideal values, and the departure time is decreased greatly. It is verified by Lorenz, Rossler and Chen systems.

It is of benefit to contract technology exerting more influence on program quality assurance. Since the research of invariant detection technology has just started that the rough detection usually use hypothesis verification approach which relies on the experience of the detector and his degree of understanding of the detected program so that there is serious lack of accuracy and efficiency. This paper tempts to divide the invariants into two kinds that one is called functional invariant and the other is non-functional type based on relational data theory before starting the invariant detection. The paper focuses on the approach of detecting functional likely invariant, which accomplish detecting existence of them by discovering functional dependence set of the program variable at first and then detecting the forms of the existent invariants after deducing the function dependence set. Experiments demonstrate that this approach not only solves the problems of blind detection to improve the efficiency but also reduces the possibility of missing important functional invariants compared with the traditional hypothesis verification approach such as Daikon.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5364452","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5364452","","Relational databases;Contracts;Computer science;Detectors;Testing;Software quality;Instruments;Quality assurance;Data analysis;Application software","functional programming;program diagnostics;program verification;quality assurance;relational databases;software quality;system monitoring","relational database theory;functional likely program invariants;nonformal description;contract technology;program quality assurance;invariant detection technology;hypothesis verification approach;functional invariant;nonfunctional invariant;program variable;function dependence set;blind detection problem;Daikon;static analysis;dynamic analysis","","1","","16","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then we develop a new solution generating rules, which uses random choose, judge, exchange three steps for constructing the simulated annealing to fit the special job-shop scheduling problems and improve the constructed solutions. Therefore, when the ant colony optimization fall into a local optimum, simulated annealing is used to help the intermediate result jumping out of local optimum, and the global optimum is improved in turn.

It is not easy to get efficient detection algorithms because of complexity, diversity of pavement images and pavement distress's weak information. In this paper, a new approach of pavement cracks detection based on FDWT (fractional differential and wavelet transform) is proposed. Fractional differential can effectively enhance high-frequency, medium-frequency signals and non-linearly preserve low-frequency signals. After fractional differential covering module is constructed and applied to road images, pavement crack reinforcement is implemented even if the crack is weak signal in smooth area. Then in order to filter noise, wavelet transform is carried out. This approach can reinforce availably pavement images and get better effect especial for weak crack information in smooth area. Experimental results proved that the proposed detection was a valid method for the different road crack image even if there is any noise exists.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5362561","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5362561","","Roads;Wavelet transforms;Computer science;Surface cracks;Detection algorithms;Image processing;1f noise;Water resources;Image analysis;Machine vision","civil engineering computing;crack detection;image processing;maintenance engineering;roads;wavelet transforms","pavement cracks detection;fractional differential and wavelet transform;automatic detection;road cracks;pavement images;medium-frequency signals;nonlinearly preserve low-frequency signals;filter noise","","5","","6","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These support vector methods implicitly assume that training data in the optimization problems to be known exactly. But in practice, the training data are usually subjected to measurement noise. Zhao et al proposed robust version to bounded C- SVMs, bounded v-SVMs and Lagrangian SVMs (LSVMs) respectively with perturbations in convex polyhedrons and ellipsoids. The region of perturbation in the methods mentioned above is not general, and there are many perturbations in non-convex regions in practice. Therefore we proposed unsupervised and semisupervised classification problems based on bounded v-support vector machines with general polyhedral perturbations. But the problem has difficulty to compute, we will find its semidefinite relaxation that can approximate it well.

With our experimental data with very small sample size, a model of corrosion rate is built. After specialized data preprocessing, we introduce the novel method of feature selection based on support vector machine (SVM). We demonstrate experimentally that the factors selected by this algorithm yield better modelling precision. Least square (LS) based feature selection method is also included in our experiment to reveal the superiority of SVM algorithm in our problem.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5365365","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5365365","","Corrosion;Atmospheric modeling;Support vector machines;Materials science and technology;Costs;Data preprocessing;Environmental factors;Least squares methods;Humans;Data mining","environmental factors;environmental science computing;least squares approximations;support vector machines","atmospheric corrosion modelling;SVM based feature selection;support vector machine;environmental factors;data preprocessing;least square method","","1","","6","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a new ocean acoustic model is developed in computational oceanographic physics, which is called ray-mode-parabolic equation (RMPE) theory. The RMPE solution is expressed in terms of the normal modes in vertical direction and the mode coefficients in horizontal direction. The model is based on the beam-displacement raymode (BDRM) theory and the parabolic equation (PE) method. By using the BDRM theory, the normal mode analysis can be processed efficiently and rapidly. The PE method is used to solve the wave equations for mode coefficients. The numerical simulations on sound propagation and the comparison with experimental data from a sloping-bottom area in South China Sea are discussed. The results show that it is efficient and practical to apply this model to solving problems involing underwater sound propagation in range-dependent ocean.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5363901","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5363901","","Oceans;Computational modeling;Physics computing;Acoustic propagation;Partial differential equations;Navigation;Underwater communication;Underwater vehicles;Frequency;Underwater acoustics","geophysics computing;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;parabolic equations;underwater sound","ocean acoustic model;computational ocean acoustics;ray-mode-parabolic equation theory;beam-displacement raymode theory;normal mode analysis;sloping-bottom area;South China Sea;underwater sound propagation","","","","4","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

ADSF searches for the optional direction, which maximizes the ratio of the local between-class distance and the local within-class distance in the projected space. The distances defined require only information about the neighborhood, while no assumption is made about the underlying data distribution. ADSF adaptively measures the neighborhood relation and estimates the similar probability of pairs of samples more reasonably.

This paper will construct a new expert system with the artificial neural network into and fault tree. Besides fault tree and neural network, this article mainly introduces the system model of fault diagnosis of the fire control computer and sensor subsystem, the method and process of fault diagnosis. In this expert system, we use the object-oriented production rule to represent the knowledge, which solves the bottleneck problem of the diagnostic knowledge acquisition effectively. The inferential process begins with the abnormal event and finally finds all of the possible faults and the faulty component. For some possible faulty components, which have large number of fault samples, the neural network model can be used to diagnose. The training network of fault samples employs the BP neural network. Finally, simulation training results show that the fault diagnosis expert system based on the combination of fault tree and neural network is rational and effective in fault diagnosis of the fire control system, realizes perfectly the combination of new knowledge and old one, and can grasp the state of systems dynamically.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5365615","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5365615","","Fault diagnosis;Diagnostic expert systems;Neural networks;Artificial neural networks;Knowledge acquisition;Fault trees;Object oriented modeling;Fires;Fault tolerant systems;Associative memory","expert systems;fault diagnosis;fault trees;knowledge acquisition;neural nets;object-oriented methods","fault diagnosis expert system;fault tree;knowledge acquisition;artificial neural network;associative memory function;fire control computer;sensor subsystem;object-oriented production rule","","7","","4","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

After that, an adaptive threshold is used to segment the image and automatically separate the moving impurity from background. To be adapted to the change of the block grey value, a fuzzy logic controller is adopted to adjust the threshold adaptively according to the block variance and mean.

The grade ¿ zone is 10.76% of the total evaluation region, locates mainly in the central area of the total region, which has better engineering geology conditions and good development potentiality. The grade ¿ zone locates mainly in the plain area of main urban district, which has good geology conditions and stable bearing strata, suitable for multilayer construction use and urban expansion. The grade ¿ zone has complicated geological conditions and bearing situations. The grade ¿ zone locates mainly in hilly area, which has steep gradients and poor geology conditions, and not suitable for scaled construction. Research conclusion shows the BPNN model is suitable for Hangzhou case, which has little relationships with subjective factors for indices' weights, requires highly for sample selection and training. The Hangzhou case BPNN model, evaluation indices, GIS data process also can be used for related studies.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5365296","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5365296","","Geographic Information Systems;Geology;Rivers;Lakes;Cities and towns;Hazards;Soil;Surfaces;Hydrology;Chemicals","backpropagation;data analysis;geographic information systems;geology;neural nets","BPNN model;GIS spatial analysis;Hangzhou construction land geology environment;construction land geology environment suitability evaluation;evaluation indices system set up;quantitative analysis;hydrogeology;engineering geology conditions;multilayer construction;urban expansion;GIS data process;backpropagation neural network;China","","1","","11","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose the keyblock distribution based wood image retrieval algorithm, in order to make the wood image retrieval algorithm more precise and objective. Keyblocks are the representative blocks that we extract from all the candidate blocks. All the keyblocks form the codebook which is used to encode the wood image. By encoding the wood image into the form of index matrix we can extract the feature vector of the wood image. This keyblock distribution based wood image retrieval algorithm is similar to the keyword based text retrieval algorithm. In the text retrieval algorithm, keyword can be used to represent the content of the text. Similarly, the keyblock in our proposed algorithm can be used to represent the content characteristics of wood images. Keyblock can extract the spatial distribution of wood image's characteristics.

Endstopped cells in cortical area VI, which combine outputs of complex cells tuned to different orientations, serve to detect line and edge crossings (junctions) and points with a large curvature. This property is used for corner and vertex detection in this paper. We utilize the endstopped neurons model of Dobbins, and apply a novel scheme to select the ""cornerness"" measurement, so the edges and textures can be rejected automatically. Experimental results with synthetic images and natural images show that the proposed method detects corners and vertices more efficiently and accurately, performs better in the presence of noise than Harris and Susan detectors, and the detections keep stable under image distortions.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5366640","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5366640","","Neurons;Detectors;Image edge detection;Brain modeling;Computer vision;Educational institutions;Paper technology;Motion detection;Bars;Mechatronics","edge detection","cognitive vision inspired corner detection;vertex detection;endstopped cells;cortical area VI;line detection;edge crossing detection;endstopped neurons model;cornerness measurement;image distortions","","","","18","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to make the task scheduling be more close to actual process of emergencies, the constrained optimal task scheduling problem (COTSP) which considering the implementation sequence of tasks is proposed. Then, the flow network model with cost is built based on instance of COTSP, and it is proved that COTSP can be solved in polynomial time by using minimum cost flow theory on the flow network model. Finally, Iterative Minimum Cost Flow Algorithm (IMCA) is designed to solve COTSP, and IMCA is proved be able to actually derive the optimal solution of COTSP by analyzing the process of IMCA.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5362598","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5362598","","Multiagent systems;Polynomials;Iterative algorithms;Optimal scheduling;Algorithm design and analysis;Scheduling algorithm;Cost function;Open systems;Collaborative work;Protocols","computational complexity;iterative methods;multi-agent systems;scheduling","multi-agent system;polynomial time algorithm;constrained optimal task scheduling problem;iterative minimum cost flow algorithm;emergency system characteristic","","","","11","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But the precision can not be very high and artificial fish (AF) often suffers the problem of being trapped in local optima. Especially when the objective function is a multimodel function, this problem is more prominent. Since chaotic mapping enjoys certainty, ergodicity and stochastic property, chaotic search can serve as a kind of method for global optimization. Feedback can also act as a strategy to lead the movement of AF. In this paper, chaotic search and feedback strategy are introduced into AFSA to overcome the shortcoming above. The experimental results show that the improved AFSA can obtain better results than the standard AFSA.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5366958","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5366958","","Marine animals;Chaos;Feedback;Convergence;Artificial intelligence;Particle swarm optimization;Stochastic processes;Clustering algorithms;Information science;Robustness","feedback;optimisation","improved artificial fish swarm algorithm;chaotic search;feedback strategy;global optimization","","8","","9","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Its purpose is to help XML producers minimize the size effects of XML, e.g. the size overhead and slow implementation speed. Comprehensive simulations show that the SXML could reduce the size of XML documents and reduce the time of implementation, consequently utilize the bandwidth effectively.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5362995","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5362995","","XML;Bandwidth;Telephone sets;Redundancy;Encoding;Information systems;Design methodology;Costs;Markup languages;Web and internet services","computer aided instruction;document handling;mobile computing;Web services;XML","SXML;mobile learning;XML documents;extensible markup language;textual markup language;Internet;Web service","","1","","12","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, it reduces to the vertex cover problem if L = 0. This problem arises from link-monitoring in computer networks. Generalizing the works of Horton and Lopez-Ortiz (2003) and Kumar and Kaur (2006), Sasaki, Zhao and Nagamochi (2008) formulated the BPP and showed the NP-hardness for all L. They also provided an exact and an approximate algorithm for this problem. In this paper, we first generalize the problem to a robust covering formulation which, for all edges e, asks whether there exist at least re L-beacons that can reach at least one of the two endpoints of e, where re ¿ ¿+ is a given robustness requirement.

With the characteristic of NTRUSign, our scheme has more effective the key generation and rapid computation speed than other similar schemes based on RSA or ECC. The signers in our scheme are all anonymous so that no one can forge the signing key composed of the hash value of the original and all the proxy signers' identities. The secretly chosen small polynomials were transmitted among signers according to a certain order without secure channels. The signing key is the combination of the original and all the proxy signers' keys. We also show our INBAMPS scheme satisfies all the properties of the general multi-signature scheme. And we point out that our scheme is resist to existential message attack based on repairing NTRUSign.

Therefore, disaster prevention and reduction, and life and possession protection are very important and to be imperative under the circumstances. Many Doppler radar covering extensive areas are erected along the coast of Southeastern China, and they are crucial for monitoring and warning of severe weather. The radial velocity information received by Doppler radar can be recovered to real wind field by some retrieval method, which is important for the research on wind field structure and development and evolvement of typhoons. Velocity volume processing (VVP) is one of the mainly used methods for wind field retrieval. However, VVP method is disturbed by ill-conditioned matrix in calculation, leading to great error and thus its application is too much limited. Step velocity volume processing (SVVP) is an improved VVP method. It efficiently overcomes the ill-conditioned matrix problem in VVP method, and can acquire exact horizontal wind, horizontal shear, vertical wind, etc. In this paper, it is attempted to retrieve the three-dimensional wind field of typhoon by SVVP method.

With iteration function system (IFS) algorithm to perform single-plant simulation, a modified IFS iterative algorithm was proposed. The new method overcomes the drawback in original IFS iteration algorithm, i.e., too much self-similarity, and makes grown trees more authentic. In the mean time, the IFS fractal simplification algorithm was proposed, with which the program running efficiency can be improved provided that tree conformation is not affected. This paper presents a fractal growth method with a growth model to control IFS, which combines the improved algorithm and the growth model.

Therefore, an inlining algorithm based on program dependence graph is proposed. It uses simple function call tree to determine the sequence of inlining and adopts program dependence graph as the intermediate representation for a program. Inline expansion is performed on program dependence graphs, and a single program dependence graph without call node is produced in the end, so that the original program is transformed into a semantically equivalent program that is free of function invocation. This algorithm has already been applied to the code normalization process of an automatic grading system of student programs and a similar code detection system. Test results show that it can improve the variation removal rate of the code normalization and facilitate program analysis.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5364393","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5364393","","Algorithm design and analysis;Optimizing compilers;Tree graphs;Computer science;Testing;Software maintenance;Functional programming;Impedance","program diagnostics;trees (mathematics)","function inlining algorithm;program analysis;optimizing compiler;program dependence graph;function call tree","","","","13","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Feature selection is an effective dimensionality reduction technique. However, there are only a few methods proposed for feature selection for clustering. In this paper, a new feature selection algorithm for unsupervised learning is introduced. It is based on the assumption that, in absence of class labels, the weighted clusterer ensemble result can be employed as a heuristic to guide the feature selection. Therefore, the ReliefF algorithm is then used to assign the rankings for every feature. The main advantage of the proposed method in comparison to conventional schemes in unsupervised feature selection is that it is dimensionality unbiased. Our experiments with several data sets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to detect completely irrelevant features and to remove some additional features without significantly hurting the performance of the clustering algorithm.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5364285","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5364285","","Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Unsupervised learning;Filters;Business;Robust stability;Machine learning;Computer vision;Computer networks;Neural networks","data mining;feature extraction;pattern clustering;unsupervised learning","feature selection;weighted clusterer ensemble;data mining;dimensionality reduction;unsupervised learning;ReliefF algorithm;feature ranking;clustering algorithm","","","","13","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To facilitate the development, we propose a quantitative way to measure CSR and formulate CSR in a multiple objective portfolio selection model as an extension of traditional Markowitz' portfolio selection model. Based on Chinese stocks by industries, we calculate the stocks' CSR measurements and perform model optimization by computing the efficient portfolios. Comparing with major indexes of Chinese stock markets as benchmarks by t-tests, some efficient portfolios outperform the indexes and therefore can justify our approach. Moreover, our methodology stems from established measurements of CSR and latest enrichments of programming methodology and finance and therefore can be applicable to CSR research worldwide. At the early stage of research by the intersection of programming methodology and finance, more important and inspiring questions are raised than answered.

The optimizing problem has to become more complex and uncertain because of the complexity of the drilling engineering. It is imperious to introduce the new optimization method and theory to solve the multi-functional problem and the uncertainty, which has many evaluation indexes and multivariate influence parameters. In this paper, an optimization method based on Case-Based Reasoning is provided to solve the optimization problem in drilling engineering and conquer the limitation of the conventional method. The method is divided into three parts. Firstly, the database of drilling parameters is established. Secondly, the drilling parameters optimization model is set up according to the case-based reasoning (CBR) theory. Finally, the drilling case search is carried on to gain the optimization results, which are carefully analyzed. This method is used to optimize the drilling parameters in daqing XuQu and the results are feasible. The drilling parameters optimization method based on CBR theory makes the drilling engineering and case reasoning organic integrate. The method is a very meaningful to solve the uncertainty in the drilling and it also makes the application of the case reasoning better and provides a bran-new research method to optimize the drilling parameters.

The results of non reacting computation reveal that the airflow velocity deceases in the majority zone of combustor with the solid fuel boundary regression. The results of reacting computation reveal that the supersonic zone in the divergent section of three cases gets larger than non reaction case. Combustion takes place in the vicinity of solid fuel wall. Combustion efficiency is in the range of 35%~45%.

The control system is designed using two neural networks. One neural network with single neuron is used for the realization of the PID controller; the other three-layered RBF neural network is used to identify PMSM system to provide the sensitivity information to the neural controller. Also, to guarantee the stability and tracking performance of the control system, a modified gradient descendent (MGD) method for the weights tuning of the neural controller is derived with the introduction of a modified optimal quadric performance index. Thus, the proposed control scheme is capable of reconciling the conflict between the tracking performance and anti-disturbance ability of controller for the linear servo system. Finally, the simulation validation results have shown that the proposed method presents a good tracking performance and satisfactory robustness against the parametric variation and ambient disturbances.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5365055","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5365055","","Three-term control;Optimal control;Neural networks;Control systems;Synchronous motors;Neurons;Stability;Performance analysis;Servomechanisms;Robustness","gradient methods;linear systems;machine control;neurocontrollers;optimal control;permanent magnet motors;radial basis function networks;servomechanisms;stability;synchronous motors;three-term control","optimal PID controller;linear servo-system;radical basis function neural networks;direct-drive permanent magnet linear synchronous motor;three-layered RBF neural network;neural controller;stability;modified gradient descendent method;modified optimal quadric performance index;simulation validation","","","","9","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With comprehensive analysis of primary factors impacting water quality, say pollutant concentration, water flow velocity, water discharge amount and natural degradation, we build an estimation model of river pollutant discharge rate based on one-dimensional water quality model. Considering that the distribution of waste outlets along a river is indeterminate, we assume that waste outlets of a river section concentrate at the beginning or the ending of the section. Under this assumption, the maximal discharge rate and the minimal discharge rate of the waste outlets are computed, and their average value yields the discharge rate of the river. Take the Yangtze River for example. Using the practical testing data from observing stations along the mainstream, we determine the origin and the discharge rate of ammonia nitrogen pollutant. The example shows that both the model and the analysis method are effective and adaptable.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5364215","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5364215","","Water pollution;Rivers;Degradation;Water resources;Information science;Testing;Protection;Wastewater;Paper technology;Nitrogen","estimation theory;nitrogen compounds;river pollution;water quality","estimation model;river pollutant discharge rate;1D water quality model;pollutant concentration;water flow velocity;water discharge amount;natural degradation;waste outlets;river section concentrate;ammonia nitrogen pollutant","","","","3","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, the geometric model of the manipulator is introduced, and then the inverse kinematics and velocity equations are developed. Afterwards, a new kinetostatic model of the mechanism is presented based on lumped flexibilities theory.

These databases can only be accessed through the query interfaces. The data information in these databases can only be obtained by data sampling. Efficient and uniform data sampling approach is very important to other research work, such as data source selection and ranking, for the data samples can give insight into the data quality, freshness and coverage information in the databases. However, the existing hidden database samplers are very inefficient, because lots of queries are wasted in the sampling walks. In this paper, we propose a probability selection and rule mining based sampling approach to solve this problem. First, we leverage the historical valid walks to calculate the valid probability of the attribute values. Based on the valid probability, we give priority to sample using the attribute values with largest valid probability and guide the sampler to find the valid sampling path earlier. Meanwhile, we save the underflow walk path to mine the underflow rules, which are used in the sampling process to guide the sampler to avoid the underflow walks. The experimental results indicate that our approach can improve the sampling efficiency by detecting the valid path earlier and avoid many underflow queries.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5362897","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5362897","","Sampling methods;Spatial databases;Probability;Data mining;Legged locomotion;Search engines","data mining;database management systems;Internet;probability;sampling methods","deep Web databases sampling;probability selection;rule mining;data sampling;data quality","","","","5","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By integrating with the underlying collagen fibres, these collagen bundles also contribute to allow the loading capacity of the normal articular cartilage.

For this reason, to learn the user specific interests will help in identifying the masqueraders. This is a new attempt.

Institutional investors in China are undergoing an explosive development, thus it's natural to wonder whether there's conflict of interest in China. This paper puts forward several common ways of conflict of interest or even conspiracy and examines our proposal by empirical model with data of listed companies from 2004 to 2008.The empirical result firmly supports the possibility of conflict of interest or even conspiracy between mutual fund managers and corporate managers, which keeps in line with the empirical study conducted by US scholars.

On the basis of the assumption that the prior distribution of the original image coefficients and the noise's are both Gaussian in the contourlet domain, this method firstly makes use of the rule of Maximum a Posteriori to compute the shrinkable factor for the contourlet coefficients, then modifies it by taking decomposable scale and directional energy into account. Finally, a denoised and enhanced image can be obtained after the contourlet coefficients, which are shrunk by the modified shrinkable factor, are made by the reverse contourlet transform. The contourlet transform has not the character of translation-invariance, so the cycle spinning method is applied to the whole denoising procedure to overcome the drawback. The experimental results show that the method given by this paper, compared with the general denoising algorithm of wavelet and contourlet, can enhance image details, stretch image contrast and produce a good visual effect though it has a little loss of PSNR (Peak Signal Noise Ratio). The enhancing idea of coefficients in the contourlet domain proposed by this paper can apply to other algorithms based on proportional shrinkage.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5366544","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5366544","","Noise reduction;Infrared imaging;Image denoising;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Gaussian noise;Spinning;Image enhancement;Image edge detection;Space technology","Gaussian noise;image denoising;image enhancement;maximum likelihood estimation;transforms","adaptive denoising;MAP rule;contourlet domain;infrared image;detail enhancement;image coefficients;Gaussian noise;maximum a posteriori rule;contourlet coefficients;decomposable scale;directional energy;reverse contourlet transform;cycle spinning method","","1","","9","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When dealing with large, continuous, even with the noise and abnormal data, the traditional decision tree algorithm seems very incompetent, encountering the efficiency of the bottleneck and classification error. In this paper, there exist the shortcomings for the decision tree algorithm to deal with multi-attribute data sources. The multivariate statistical methods is proposed to make the principal component analysis on multi-attribute data, reducing dimensionality, devoicing processing and transforming the traditional decision tree algorithm to form a new algorithm model.

Different from conventional Kansei engineering system, collaborative Kansei engineering system aims to deal with the impact of different operators' emotions on the same type construction machinery. The system has an excellent merit of integrating advanced collaborative Kansei characteristics of operator such as affections, feelings, emotions, etc, to construction machinery. In contrast to general intelligent maintenance system, this new IMS is more comprehensive, creative and humanized. Modern construction machinery with the IMS is able to add more recognition, understanding, and cooperative communications between operator and machinery. More importantly, the IMS based on collaborative Kansei engineering is able to fully reflect impacts of the different operators' emotions on the development and implementation of IMS for construction machinery.

Because the maximum objects throughput that can be tracked with a given accuracy is determined by the efficiency of the updates, it is the key topic that how to index these huge numbers of moving objects efficiently in this situation. The recent GTR-tree (group update & time parameter R-tree) not only buffered insertion and deletion entries and deal with them in group, but also introduced the velocity and the timestamp of moving objects to reduce the updates of objects which move at constant speed. It has high efficiency in I/O. However, the GTR-Tree holds low efficiency in CPU time because of obsolete table. This paper proposes a modified GTR-tree (call RGTR-tree for short), which could maintain high efficiency in CPU time by discard obsolete table. The new technique is empirically evaluated and compared with two other approaches and with the GTR-Tree, a competitor that is based on the R*-tree. Finally, experiment results show that both algorithms outperforms TPR*-tree in update and query performance of disk I/O, especially as most objects move at a constant speed.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5366045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5366045","","Indexing;Roads;Throughput;Databases;Robustness;Helium;Global Positioning System;Indexes;Gold;Performance analysis","database management systems;query processing;traffic engineering computing","road network;wireless techniques;GPS;maximum objects throughput;group update and time parameter R-tree;obsolete table;modified GTR-tree;query;moving object database","","","","12","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The study indicated that, to make sure good thermal comfort, proper supply air parameters would make the indoor air form better backflow, shorter air age , and bring away the heat around the radiating equipments to make the radiation temperature not too high. Furthermore, the thermal comfort was not good in such areas which were near heating radiator with high temperature, around air outlets where cold air sinks and room corners where eddy flow was usually formed. However, in working area, thermal comfort distribution was uniform, air was fresh and has shorter air age, which would met the requirement.

This paper proposes a scheme to add routing information to the routing tables. Meanwhile, it holds down the scale of routing tables by merging the items that have redundant information. In most cases, it makes the nodes actually have even less items in the routing tables than they used to. It also has the advantage that the deviation of time of routing a lookup message becomes smaller. Thus, it makes the performance of resource search more stable, the average hops of routing a lookup message diminished, the memory needed by the routing tables much less and the time of the transact shorter.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5365352","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5365352","","Fingers;Educational institutions;Redundancy;Clocks;Computer networks;Steady-state;Intelligent networks;Merging;Routing protocols;Heuristic algorithms","peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication network routing","chord network;searching resource mechanism;P2P network;redundant information;nodes routing table;routing information","","","","12","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

And then, followed by the use of co-integration analysis and Granger causality test, the paper makes an empirical study to verify the relationship, the results shows that a stable relationship exists between higher education equity and income distribution in a long-term, and higher education equity leads to the equity of income distribution while the equity of income distribution has no impact at all on higher education equity. Finally the paper puts forward some countermeasures and suggestion based on the empirical analysis.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5364759","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5364759","","Testing;Engineering profession;Technology management;Forward error correction;Government;Remuneration;Proposals","cause-effect analysis;financial management;further education","higher education equity;income distribution;Granger causality test;cointegration analysis","","1","","10","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

How to control the thickness deviation in the minimum range became an important problem of technical innovation in machine production enterprises of veneer. So there are various monitoring device for thickness emerge as. This paper introduces a kind of online testing system which uses non-destructive test method and based on beta rays. As the control core, this system uses Siemens S7-200 PLC to collect input signals, do some and display them. Combined with Siemens TP27 touch screen, the system can real-time display the thickness of the veneer, and emit a control signal to improve the system. After several experiments on aspen veneers and other different materials, the conclusion is that the basic reason for thickness deviation is the nonlinear exponential relationship between the flux density of the ray and the thickness.

In this paper, a fuzzy evolution of mathematical tumor model is considered and interpreted from different point of view. Consider a crisp continuous system whose process of evolution depends on differential equations. Such a system contains a number of parameters that must be estimated. Usually point estimates are computed and used in the model. However, these point estimates typically have uncertainty associated with them. We propose to incorporate uncertainty by using fuzzy numbers as estimates of these unknown parameters. Fuzzy parameters convert the crisp system into a fuzzy system. Trajectories describing the behavior of the system become fuzzy curves.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5365495","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5365495","","Uncertainty;Neoplasms;Mathematical model;Fuzzy systems;Biological system modeling;Differential equations;Evolution (biology);Biomedical engineering;Tumors;Target recognition","differential equations;fuzzy logic;tumours;uncertainty handling","uncertainty analysis;fuzzy differential equations;mathematical model;tumor model;crisp system","","1","","23","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An increasing number of experts have attached more importance to this subject in recent years. The input of this task is a video captured by a monocular optical camera which is installed on a vehicle. And the aim is to locate every pedestrian in each frame of the video as soon as possible. This task has two steps, i.e., region of interest (ROI) generation and pedestrian recognition in the ROIs. Since most of previous methods face the issue of large number of ROIs, so real time requirement is difficult to be achieved. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to address this problem. Our method can generate ROIs efficiently and keep the number of good ROIs as few as possible. Good ROI means it has high probability to contain crossing street pedestrian (CSP), which should be particularly concerned by drives. Our method has the following steps. Firstly, the edges of the CSPs are detected by matching the edge maps of couple frames multiple times. Secondly, ROIs are generated based on the detected CSP edges and pedestrian shape features. Thirdly, the probability of each ROI containing CSP is calculated. And these ROIs are sorted by their probability values in descending order. At last, HOG and SVM are used to recognize pedestrian only in the top 12 ROIs. The results from real experiments confirm the good performance and high efficiency of our method.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5366155","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5366155","","Vehicle detection;Intelligent vehicles;Probability;Support vector machines;Image edge detection;Cameras;Shape;Intelligent transportation systems;Motion detection;Vehicle driving","automated highways;image recognition;probability;support vector machines;video signal processing","real time ROI generation;pedestrian detection;intelligent vehicle;driver assistance system;pedestrian location;video frame;region of interest generation;pedestrian recognition;probability;crossing street pedestrian;edge map;pedestrian shape feature;histograms of oriented gradient;support vector machine","","3","","10","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Ill-posed problems could be attributed to the First Class of Operator Equations in normal. The TSVD regularized method is introduced for ill-posed problems in this paper. This method mainly is built on the Operator matrix's singular value decomposition in the First Class of Operator Equations, and then in accordance with the characteristics of singular value to select the best regularization parameters. For TSVD method, by choosing an appropriate truncate parameter k, we truncated the small singular value after k which in the expression of least squares solution, because small singular values would affect the solution greatly when there are noises in data of the ill-posed problem. And then Filter Functions is also identified. GCV and L-Curve are adopted in determining the regularization parameter. Finally, one-dimensional magnetotelluric inversion is selected as an example to demonstrate the TSVD which is accuracy and practicality.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5363565","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5363565","","Inverse problems;Equations;Magnetic separation;Geophysics;Uncertainty;Data acquisition;Matrix decomposition;Singular value decomposition;Least squares methods;Filters","geophysics;inverse problems;least squares approximations;matrix inversion;singular value decomposition","truncated SVD methods;MT discrete linear ill-posed inverse problems;geophysics complexity;data acquisition;geophysical inversion;geophysical ill-posed problem;first class of operator equations;TSVD regularized method;singular value decomposition;truncate parameter;least squares solution;filter functions;GCV;L-Curve;regularization parameter;magnetotelluric inversion","","1","","13","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consequently, trustworthiness of a user is divided into two parts: trustworthiness of the target resource domain to the user and trustworthiness of target resource to the user domain.

Though such queries have been studied quite extensively in Euclidean spaces, there are few works for objects moving on the road network. In this paper, we first propose an update-efficient data structure to index current positions of moving object in road networks. Then, based on the proposed index structure, we design a new RNN query algorithm, namely the RNN_Turn_MO. In contrast to existing methods, turn restriction of road network are taken into more consideration so that the query result can better meet the need of our real lives. The experimental studies show our methods can support RNN query considering turn prohibition efficiently.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5364547","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5364547","","Nearest neighbor searches;Recurrent neural networks;Intelligent transportation systems;Road transportation;Query processing;Laboratories;Remote sensing;Data structures;Intelligent networks;Algorithm design and analysis","query processing;road traffic;traffic engineering computing;visual databases","reverse nearest neighbors query;moving object;road network;location-based service;intelligent transportation system;reverse nearest neighbors search;update-efficient data structure;object position;index structure;RNN query algorithm;RNN_Turn_MO;turn restriction;turn prohibition","","","","10","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Firstly, a visual model is employed to calculate the block based just noticeable difference (JND). Then, two neighboring image blocks are selected each time from the color component with Hilbert scanning order, and transformed by discrete wavelet transform (DWT) respectively. Lastly, according to the JND and the secret bit, the means size relation of two relative detail sub-bands coefficients in DWT domain is adjusted to hide the data.

Studying its control methods is a hot spot of vehicle dynamics. Based on the in-depth study of the vehicular handling dynamics and the advanced control theory, the PID, fuzzy and intelligent integral fuzzy-PID controllers for DYC system are designed and simulated with the vehicle model. The fuzzy control theory has great superiority in some systems that need a lot of experiment knowledge and experience such as DYC. The structure of fuzzy-PID controller is proposed by Bialkowski in 1983 and it is proved that it can eliminate the error of fuzzy system. The intelligent integral is introduced to avoid the limitation of normal integral. Simulation results of the controllers are compared and indicate that all the controllers can realize the effective control of DYC, and have their own characteristics. Intelligent integral fuzzy-PID has more rapid response and higher control precision, and has much better applying prospect. Intelligent integral module can reduce the side effect of integral function, so the control effect of fuzzy-PID is further improved.

Political pressure often results in incidence bias in favor of the rich. This paper argues that the bias in political influence resulting from extreme income inequalities is particularly likely to generate an incidence bias, which we call social exclusion. In this paper it has been argued that, while this is a worthy policy goal in terms of equality and long-run growth, there are deeply rooted political reasons for existing provision arrangements to be unfavorable to the poor. It implies that the political bias induced by extreme income inequality is one major obstacle in a reform of existing programs, and opposition by influential political interests is to be taken into account in a meaningful debate about the implementation of more egalitarian reforms.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5365930","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5365930","","Educational programs;Mirrors;Africa;Transportation;Pediatrics;Educational institutions;Vehicle dynamics;Convergence","economics;politics","education expenditure;political influence bias;income inequality;incidence bias;social exclusion","","1","","12","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to its nature of lacking a centralized coordination, a P2P application is challenged by efficiently locating the desired data objects distributed over the participating peers. In this paper, we present a two dimensional structure and the associated protocols for organizing peers into overlay networks. In the proposed overlay networks, distributed hash techniques are used to map a peer into a 2D space, within which one dimension is for the management of data objects, and the other is for fast query routing. The simulation experiments shows that the proposed methodology is able to achieve improved object search efficiency while keep the maintenance overhead low, making it an applicable way to manage large scale P2P applications.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5362978","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5362978","","Peer to peer computing;Network topology;Costs;Telecommunication traffic;IP networks;Protocols;Large-scale systems;Organizing;Query processing;Acceleration","file organisation;Internet;peer-to-peer computing","2D overlay peer-to-peer networks;Internet;network resources;distributed hash techniques;data object management;query routing","","","","12","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

TSVM (transductive support vector machine) takes into account a particular test set and tries to minimize misclassifications of just those particular examples. PTSVM (progressive transductive support vector machine) can automatically adapt to different data distributions and realize a transductive learning of support vectors in a more general sense. However, the process of pairwise labeling of PTSVM in the margin band is unnatural and products errors more easily. Although dynamical adjusting offers some sort of error recovery function, its ability is limited. In allusion to the shortcomings of PTSVM learning algorithm, ICPTSVM (an improved cache-based PTSVM) learning algorithm is presented. The algorithm uses pairwise labeling in the range and error-correcting on cache to replace pairwise labeling in the margin band and dynamical adjusting. Then it greatly reduces the number of mis-labeling and improves the speed and accuracy. Experiments data show the validity of this algorithm.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5365786","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5365786","","Labeling;Support vector machines;Machine learning;Pattern recognition;Statistical learning;Software performance;Testing;Software algorithms;Sun;Inference algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern recognition;support vector machines","transductive learning algorithm;high dimensional pattern recognition;progressive transductive support vector machine;pairwise labeling;error recovery function;error-correcting","","","","13","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

SMD concentrates on the video quality and robustness, hosts can join the different overlay trees in different layers simultaneously, then the maximum covering set (MCS) based on acquired descriptions information is figured out to achieve the best video quality. To mine the potential of hosts and lower link stress, we propose efficient caching strategies to make tradeoff between them with low overhead.

It is preponderant to settle the multi-objective optimization using particle swarm optimization (PSO). But services composition that can not adapt complicated variety in general PSO algorithm has slow convergence speed and strict speed demand. The paper simulates the bird flocking environment-aware behavior in seeking food process. 1) Bird flocking orient the later seek food based on the former successful experience to avoid ineffective searching behaviour; 2)Bird flocking which have definite visual field can enough fly far, whilst they needn't local search such as PSO to increase the algorithm speed. It presented an environment-aware particle swarm optimization algorithm(EAPSO). EAPSO decreases unsteadiness resulting from random search and increases algorithm speed by method recollecting optimized population and increasing visual field.

It mainly includes two steps: Firstly, the faulty run trace is divided into segments by analyzing the differences between correct run and faulty run, and only the segments that inducing the differences between dual-traces will be regarded as suspicious fault-area; Secondly, the suspicious fault-area will be further sliced by trace slice to reduce the fault-area, and the more accuracy fault-area will be gained finally.

By minimize the cost function it can get the array covariance matrix and compensate the array uncertainty without estimation. Therefore, the proposed method is advantage over the source calibration algorithm that resorts to computing the sample minimize cost function. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by using the actual parameter of multiple beam antenna, and the computer simulations show that the proposed method provide comparable performance that can not only self-calibrate its sensitivity to the array uncertainty with reduce complexity compute with resource, but also further increase its precision.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5363465","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5363465","","Directional antennas;Direction of arrival estimation;Uncertainty;Cost function;Amplitude estimation;Phase estimation;Multiple signal classification;Classification algorithms;Covariance matrix;Calibration","antennas;calibration;covariance matrices;direction-of-arrival estimation;signal classification","self-calibration algorithm;phase error;amplitude error;multiple beam antenna;direction of arrival estimation;multiple signal classification algorithm;MUSIC algorithm;DOA estimation;array covariance matrix;source calibration algorithm","","4","","8","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Graph grammars can be used to generate graph languages which is similar to Chomsky grammars in formal language theory. Moreover, graphs can be used to model the states of all kinds of systems, which allows one to use graph transformation to model state changes in these systems. A rule-based transformation system may show two kinds of nondeterminism: (1) for each rule can exist several matches, and (2) several rules can be applicable. This paper concentrates on the second non-determinism, studying a method to detect the rules which are not applicable in graph transformation systems, proposing a backward graph transformation conflict detecting algorithm.

However, due to mainly focus on the description of the functional part, it is difficult for them to select the best services with consideration of quality of service (QoS). To solve this problem, the WSMO specification is extended and an ontology-based meta-model of QoS called WSMO-QoS is presented in the paper. Furthermore, a QoS-based discovery framework for semantic Web service is proposed, which support service discovery from three phases: basic description, IOPE and QoS.

On the other hand, in the real applications, it is unrealistic to guarantee all sensors have the same energy because they have different energy consumption. In this paper, A cluster based data gathering protocol for heterogeneous energy WSNs (EDGA) is proposed. EDGA achieves a good performance in terms of lifetime by minimizing energy consumption for in-network communications and balancing the energy load. EDGA improves the cluster-based LEACH data gathering protocol, and adopts the weighted election probabilities of each node to handle the heterogeneous energy WSN. Moreover, it also introduces a simple but efficient approach to solve the intra-cluster coverage problem. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed EDGA significantly outperforms LEACH, HEED in terms of network lifetime and the amount of data gathered in the heterogeneous energy network.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5365830","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5365830","","Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks;Clustering algorithms;Base stations;Routing;Computer networks;Application software;Energy consumption;Nominations and elections;Scalability","pattern clustering;probability;protocols;telecommunication computing;wireless sensor networks","cluster based data gathering protocol;heterogeneous wireless sensor networks;EDGA protocol;LEACH protocol;weighted election probability;HEED protocol","","","","9","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose an active multi-path inter-domain routing protocol called AMIR that can be deployed incrementally as an extension to today's BGP protocol. In AMIR, routers learn default best routes and some candidate routes from their neighbors and make decision to satisfy the custom needs.

However, there is still a significant challenge for bridging the semantic gap between structured geospatial data in GISs and un-analytical spatial information in natural language. The representation and analysis of spatial relations has been one of generic issues in geographical information science. This paper presents a rule-based approach to spatial relation extraction in natural language text. Based on geographical named entity recognition technology and a spatial relation annotation corpus, syntactical rules of spatial relations are induced and then formalized into JAPE of the natural language processing platform GATE. Geographical named entities and spatial relations in new documents can be detected effectively in GATE. The experimental results indicate that spatial relations are usually described with several syntactical patterns in natural language, especially directional spatial relations, but topological relations are much more complicated. The fact is that rule-based extraction approaches can be implemented and integrated by means of fewer efforts than machine learning algorithms. It is known that directional spatial relations are more popularly used in natural language than topological spatial relations. Therefore, we conclude that it is practical and effective to extract spatial relations in natural language with rule-based approaches.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5363900","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5363900","","Natural languages;Data mining;Geography;Information analysis;Information science;Cities and towns;Information systems;Natural language processing;Machine learning algorithms;Layout","geographic information systems;knowledge based systems;natural language processing","rule-based extraction;spatial relation extraction;natural language text;intelligent geographical information system;GIS;structured geospatial data;geographical named entity recognition technology;spatial relation annotation corpus;JAPE;GATE","","17","","18","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Considering the random character of the design parameters and load-bearing capacity, the fuzzy optimization mathematic model is established to minimize the number of belt transmission in conveying drive. The method of second-class comprehensive evaluation was used by the optimal level cut set, thus the fuzzy optimization is transformed into the usual optimization. Considering the problem of low efficiency and local optimum caused by traditional gradient-based optimization methods, the intelligent algorithm in hybrid genetic algorithm are developed to solve the usual optimization model, so that the optimization process is simplified and global optimum is acquired reliably.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5366493","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5366493","","Design optimization;Belts;Optimization methods;Machine intelligence;Power transmission;Machinery;Design methodology;Mathematics;Mathematical model;Fuzzy sets","belts;conveyors;drives;fuzzy set theory;genetic algorithms;gradient methods;power transmission (mechanical)","design optimization;belt transmission;intelligent algorithm;power transmission elements;load-bearing capacity;fuzzy optimization mathematic model;conveying drive;second-class comprehensive evaluation;gradient-based optimization methods;hybrid genetic algorithm","","","","6","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on the ideal of bi-stable model, there were two kinds of cellular with different action rules and different ranges, in which one submitted to fractal distribution, the other submitted to interval arrangement. Through simulation it was found sand-pile model took on Selforganized criticality (SOC) when cellular arrangement submitted to fractal distribution. Simulation result was the same as assumption.

Rice mould counts were enumerated periodically. There were lag phases for the rice mould during storage. The growth properties of rice mould were fitted to Gompertz equation precisely. The growth rate constant was between 0.015~0.6 d-1 and was influenced by heating methods and storage conditions. The growth rate constant of rice mould treated by the two heating methods was lower than that of the control, whereas the amplitude difference between the treatments and control was reduced as the temperature risen, and the value of the mould treated by microwave radiation was bigger than that of traditional heating. The equivalent mould counts increased as the temperature risen, the values of mould treated with heating are higher in comparison with the control and the difference was more obvious when the treated mould were stored in low temperature and low relative humidity.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5366890","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5366890","","Electromagnetic heating;Heat treatment;Temperature control;Microorganisms;Food technology;Humidity;Microwave theory and techniques;Chemicals;Fungi;Educational institutions","heating;humidity;moulding;warehousing","heating treatment;storage condition;mould growth property;microwave radiation;relative humidity;Gompertz equation;time 30 day","","2","","18","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our training focuses on avoiding technical failures, but unfortunately our systems sometimes have unintended consequences. We need to develop products to avoid unintended negative impacts on society, people, and the environment. Professional responsibility requires that we identify the morally salient features of a situation. Some issues are relatively easy to spot; for example, we shouldn't lie to clients, we shouldn't bribe inspectors, and we should respect people's privacy. But some ethical and social risks are harder to recognize. Even developers with the best intentions have walked into ethical traps. When we study technical problems, we apply the project's constraints and priorities to find acceptable possible solutions and choose among them. Here are four suggestions for considering ethical constraints during that process, they are: look for human values in technical decision; identifying who will be affected; examining how stakeholders' right and obligation will be affectedl; and reviewing relevant professional standards to help identify issues.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2010.23","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5370758","Ethics;risks;ethics code;stakeholder rights","Privacy;Humans","ethical aspects;software engineering","software ethical risk;professional obligation;software engineer;unintended negative impact prevention;professional responsibility;projects constraint;human value;technical decision;relevant professional standard","","2","","3","","31 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

And over their lifetime, most of those systems evolve. Developers who make modifications, fix bugs, and add new features to long-lived systems have an easier time of it if they keep the code base habitable (""Creating Sustainable Designs,"" Rebecca Wirfs-Brock, IEEE Software, May/June 2009) and preserve design integrity. But even so, maintenance can be painful when new requirements invalidate initial design assumptions. This paper discussed about methods and techniques on how to achieve software's flexible design. Flexible design is the byproduct of preparation and continued attention to detail. Where there's a lot of variability in a design problem, a flexible solution will incorporate appropriate design hooks that allow for developers to predictably add planned extensions. Once they've established ways to support specific variations, developers can follow predefined extension recipes rather than hacking in new features that are similar to existing ones.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2009.190","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5287000","responsible design;agile development;flexibility;commonality-variability analysis","Software systems;Computer bugs;Computer crime","software engineering","software modification;software debugging;design integrity;software maintenance;software flexible design;software developer;software extension","","","","","","16 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Recently, software engineering researchers interested in the collaborative nature of software development have explored the implications of this concept in the design of software development tools. A critical aspect of awareness is the associated coordinative work practices of displaying and monitoring actions. This aspect concerns how colleagues monitor one another's actions to understand how these actions impact their own work and how they display their actions in such a way that others can easily monitor them while doing their own work. In this paper, we focus on an additional aspect of awareness: the identification of the social actors who should be monitored and the actors to whom their actions should be displayed. We address this aspect by presenting software developers' work practices based on ethnographic data from three different software development teams. In addition, we illustrate how these work practices are influenced by different factors, including the organizational setting, the age of the project, and the software architecture. We discuss how our results are relevant for both CSCW and software engineering researchers.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.19","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5710950","Computer-supported cooperative work;organizational management and coordination;programming environments;programming teams;tools.","Software;Programming;Monitoring;Interviews;Collaboration;Servers","groupware;software architecture","awareness network;computer-supported cooperative work;software development;social actor;ethnographic data;organizational setting;project age;software architecture;CSCW","","35","","57","","10 Feb 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Software Abundance in the Face of Economic Scarcity, Part 2","G. Booch",IBM,"IEEE Software","16 Oct 2009","2009","26","6","15","16","The paper is an editorial that discusses the economics aspect of software industry. The author states that we are in a period of global economic funk, by virtually every measure that we can take. The good news is that we've been here before over the years and we've always seemed to get by. Software is still the most fungible and liquid of resources, and its supply is limited only by human imagination and labor. For this reason, the author began to make the case that software-intensive systems are a necessary element in helping us operate, innovate, and even thrive in the face of lean economic times. There are many opportunities in IT for fueling business, ranging from issues of daily hygiene to opportunities for creating entirely new markets. Effective business strategies must involve some mixture of efficiency-based, innovation-based, and customer-intimacy-based efforts. Software development is an engineering activity. That means not reaching for a perfect solution, but rather evolving to a solution that optimally resolves the static and dynamic forces on that system. For software-intensive systems, these forces include the usual business ones (cost, schedule, and mission) but also development, environmental, operational, and legal/ethical/moral forces. The author also noted that the enterprise's architecture, is the collection of engineering decisions and artifacts that steer the fleet (the organization) through the forces acting upon it and guide it toward its mission. Architecture-as-an-artifact is a manifestation of technical intellectual property and thus serves as an artifact of control. The author concludes that software-intensive systems are an inescapable and necessary element in helping us operate, innovate, and even thrive in the face of lean economic times.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2009.187","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5287003","economics;software engineering;innovation;economic scarcity","Environmental economics;Fuel economy;Computer industry;Industrial economics;Humans;Programming;Costs;Job shop scheduling;Law;Legal factors","socio-economic effects;software architecture;software development management","software industry;software-intensive systems;IT business opportunities;software development;enterprise architecture;engineering decisions collection;economic scarcity;architecture-as-an-artifact manifestation;technical intellectual property","","","","","","16 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Little research addresses the integration of particular COTS to specific domains. A University of Vigo project for reusable software development in the engineering domain adopted this approach. The underlying hypothesis was that making COTS integration easier would facilitate the development of domain-specific applications. The solution consists of a two-layer wrapping approach. The first layer captures the COTS domain model, facilitating integration of general-purpose functionality. A second layer provides better integration of more domain-specific functionality. Several real software development projects have used the proposed solution, and the results yielded notable effort savings, showing the approach's utility in reducing COTS integration efforts.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2011.129","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6051413","software architectures;software engineering;COTS;reusable software","Computer languages;Mathematical model;Software architecture;Libraries;Programming;Software reliability;Software measurement","","","","","","15","","18 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

We then shape it into something that is as invisible as it can be. This is, curiously, the polar opposite of what theoretical physicists do: they observe the fierce complexity of the cosmos, labor to tease apart the threads by which the cosmos is cunningly woven, then try to explain the warp and woof as well as the very nature of the strings themselves in as visible and as simple a language as possible. In the case of software-intensive systems, we start with some very simple concepts - specifically, bits and the nature of information. We then apply various human artifacts - namely, our hard ware and our software languages - to make these bits and information manifest, then we bundle them up in these massive, dripping hairballs of scattered and tangled complexity, drop them into the world, and labor mightily to make them disappear in the interstitial spaces, hidden from view.

The author states that in the face of economic scarcity, the traditional response is to retreat, shrink, slash, and try not to panic. But there's another, more creative reaction to economic scarcity: to attack. While the velocity of money may have greatly decelerated and while credit might still be a scarce resource, human imagination is not similarly constrained. Software is the most fungible and liquid of resources. The supply of software is limited only by human imagination and labor. Software has no mass, it's remarkably malleable and wonderfully versatile, and it never wears out. This is why it also argue that software intensive systems are an inescapable and necessary element in helping software people operate, innovate, and even thrive.Undeniably, software-intensive systems, even in these lean economic times, are the force behind a sea change in communication and connectivity and a force that continues to propel innovation. Innovation in times of abundance is relatively easy; even just staying alive in lean times is a struggle. The thing about abundance is that, well, abundance feels a whole lot better than scarcity.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2009.139","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5222786","economics;software engineering;innovation;economic scarcity","Videos;Humans;Wikipedia;Technological innovation;YouTube;Computer architecture;Earth;Government;Costs;Protection","innovation management;socio-economic effects;software packages","software products abundance;economic scarcity;software intensive systems;human innovation","","","","12","","25 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Buschmann",Siemens Corporate Technology,"IEEE Software","16 Oct 2009","2009","26","6","68","69","The paper is an editorial on software architecture. Software projects fail for the same reasons. The mistakes that can lead software projects to trouble before concrete architecture elaboration even begins include missing, wrong, or creeping system scope; and vague, unnecessary, or extreme nonfunctional requirements. These mistakes aren't the prime responsibility of architects, but architects are directly affected if they occur because without an appropriate system scope and correspondingly appropriate requirements, they can't define sustainable architectures. A system's scope defines its responsibilities, but also its boundaries. Failing to define a precise system scope can result in architectures that support the wrong functionality, too much functionality, too many functionality variations, too few functions, or poor quality. Architects should pay special attention to nonfunctional requirements that too often include vague or unnecessarily extreme specifications. Without precision, architects must guess which nonfunctional qualities are actually needed, and if they must guess, they'll likely guess wrong. An agile, incremental approach to software development define an initial system scope and set of requirements in a reasonable time and adjust this big picture step-wise until it has enough focus, substance, and clarity. Then, architects get concrete guidance for their work and can act rather than react when designing the system's architecture. Only then do architects receive a safety network that allows them to identify and correct design flaws in their own area of responsibility.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2009.179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5287013","software architect;software architecture;software engineering;nonfunctional requirements;requirements engineering;system scope;functionality","Concrete;Computer architecture;Software architecture;Programming;Safety","software architecture;software development management","software architecture;system scope failure;nonfunctional requirements failure;software development incremental approach;software architects","","16","","7","","16 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Regardless of whether you adhere to TDD design rhythms, writing unit tests forces you to articulate pesky edge cases and clean up your design.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2009.125","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5222803","software engineering;software design;unit tests;debugging;test-driven design","Software testing;System testing;Writing;Collaboration;Wiring;Assembly;Software performance;Heart;Rhythm;Feathers","program testing","design for test;program testing;test-driven development","","1","","","","25 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

These techniques can help reduce software evolution costs by automating many basic activities in software change processes, such as representing source code at a higher level of abstraction, providing information to analyze the impact of the changes, or automatically generating software artifacts of the evolved system.

To overcome this issue, device users often upload content into a hosting service available in the cloud. However, cloud-based hosting can alienate the control and ownership of the content. A proposed architecture views development of a cloud computing service for mobile devices from a different angle. This approach maintains the content in the device where it was first created. The resulting design leads to a mobile device cloud that treats devices, together with the content and resources they host, as first-class cloud citizens. A proof-of-concept implementation is based on standard Web protocols. The underlying design can be configured for various contexts, such as individuals having several mobile devices, social communities interested in sharing content, or companies.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2012.54","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6185528","mobile cloud;mobile data;mobile devices;content management;software engineering","Mobile handsets;Servers;Content management;Mobile communication;Cloud computing;Computer architecture","","","","3","1","8","","17 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

An architecture is just a collective hunch, a shared hallucination, an assertion by a set of stakeholders about the nature of their observable world, be it a world that is or a world as they wish it to be. An architecture therefore serves as a means of anchoring an extended set of stakeholders to a common vision of that world, a vision around which they may rally, to which they are led, and for which they work collectively to make manifest. When I say that an architecture is a shared hallucination, I mean that an architecture-as-artifact is a naming of the mutually agreed-upon set of design decisions that shape a software-intensive system. While an architecture is just an abstraction of reality, an architecture-as-artifact is a declaration of that shared reality. In this way, that shared hallucination represents a common vision among a set of stakeholders as observed simultaneously through several different points of view and represented by a set of interlocking models.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2010.4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5370767","software engineering;architecture;software architecture;modeling;stakeholders","Computer architecture;Software systems;Shape","software architecture;software management","software intensive system architecture;shared hallucination;interlocking models","","1","","","","31 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Their domain is just very wide. What has changed is the technology for creating domain-specific languages (DSLs). Now it is easier to define languages and get tool support for narrower domains. Such focus offers increased abstraction, making development faster and easier. In domain-specific approaches, developers construct solutions from concepts representing things in the problem domain, not concepts of a given general-purpose programming language. Ideally, a DSL follows the domain abstractions and semantics as closely as possible, letting developers perceive themselves as working directly with domain concepts. The created specifications might then represent simultaneously the design, implementation, and documentation of the system, which can be generated directly from them. The mapping from the high-level domain concepts to implementation is possible because of the domain specificity: the language and code generators fit the requirements of a narrowly defined domain.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2009.92","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5076453","domain-specific modeling;domain-specific languages;software engineering","Nails;Domain specific languages;Computer languages;DSL;Documentation;Hardware design languages;Insurance;Home automation;Investments;Assembly","software tools;specification languages","domain abstraction;domain semantics;domain specific language and modelling","","56","","12","","19 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

A formal-methods-based process that supports development, verification and validation, and safety analysis can help domain experts overcome these obstacles. Nuclear engineers can also use CASE tools to apply formal methods without having to know details of the underlying formalism.

In order to support the development of these systems, it is necessary to have new methods, processes, and tools. In this paper, we describe a UML-based framework to assist with the development of service-based systems. The framework adopts an iterative process in which software services that can provide functional and nonfunctional characteristics of a system being developed are discovered, and the identified services are used to reformulate the design models of the system. The framework uses a query language to represent structural, behavioral, and quality characteristics of services to be identified, and a query processor to match the queries against service registries. The matching process is based on distance measurements between the queries and service specifications. A prototype tool has been implemented. The work has been evaluated in terms of recall, precision, and performance measurements.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2009.88","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5374424","Design notations and documentation;software process models;search discovery language;service discovery engine.","Unified modeling language;Software systems;Database languages;Quality of service;Computer Society;Distance measurement;Software prototyping;Prototypes;Documentation;Engines","pattern matching;query languages;query processing;software prototyping;Unified Modeling Language;Web services","service-based system design;software systems;software code;UML-based framework;iterative process;software services;query processor;matching process;distance measurements;query language","","31","1","60","","8 Jan 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The technique also reduces the cost of running those test cases that are selected by the regression test selection algorithm by performing a selective instrumentation that reduces the number of probes required to monitor the coverage data. Users of our technique can avoid the expense of rerunning the entire test suite on Pi+1 or the inaccuracy produced by previous approaches that estimate coverage data for Pi+1 or that reuse outdated coverage data from Pi. This paper also presents a tool, RECOVER, that implements our technique, along with a set of empirical studies on a set of subjects that includes several industrial programs, versions, and test cases. The studies show the inaccuracies that can exist when an application-regression test selection-uses estimated or outdated coverage data.

How can we best explore them all? Aim: We seek aspects on general principles of effort estimation that can guide the design of effort estimators. Method: We identified the essential assumption of analogy-based effort estimation, i.e., the immediate neighbors of a project offer stable conclusions about that project. We test that assumption by generating a binary tree of clusters of effort data and comparing the variance of supertrees versus smaller subtrees. Results: For 10 data sets (from Coc81, Nasa93, Desharnais, Albrecht, ISBSG, and data from Turkish companies), we found: 1) The estimation variance of cluster subtrees is usually larger than that of cluster supertrees; 2) if analogy is restricted to the cluster trees with lower variance, then effort estimates have a significantly lower error (measured using MRE, AR, and Pred(25) with a Wilcoxon test, 95 percent confidence, compared to nearest neighbor methods that use neighborhoods of a fixed size). Conclusion: Estimation by analogy can be significantly improved by a dynamic selection of nearest neighbors, using only the project data from regions with small variance.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.27","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5728833","Software cost estimation;analogy;k-NN.","Estimation;Training;Software;Training data;Linear regression;Euclidean distance;Humans","pattern clustering;program testing;project management;software cost estimation;trees (mathematics)","analogy-based effort estimation;software effort estimator design;essential assumption;supertree variance;subtree variance;Coc81 data set;Nasa93 data set;Desharnais data set;Albrecht data set;ISBSG data set;Turkish companies;estimation variance;binary cluster tree;cluster subtrees;dynamic selection;nearest neighbor selection;project data","","106","","69","","10 Mar 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Prechelt","Freie Universität Berlin, Berlin","IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","28 Jan 2011","2011","37","1","95","108","Background: For developing Web-based applications, there exist several competing and widely used technological platforms (consisting of a programming language, framework(s), components, and tools), each with an accompanying development culture and style. Research question: Do Web development projects exhibit emergent process or product properties that are characteristic and consistent within a platform, but show relevant substantial differences across platforms or do team-to-team individual differences outweigh such differences, if any? Such a property could be positive (i.e., a platform advantage), negative, or neutral, and it might be unobvious which is which. Method: In a nonrandomized, controlled experiment, framed as a public contest called “Plat_Forms,” top-class teams of three professional programmers competed to implement the same requirements for a Web-based application within 30 hours. Three different platforms (Java EE, PHP, or Perl) were used by three teams each. We compare the resulting nine products and process records along many dimensions, both external (usability, functionality, reliability, security, etc.) and internal (size, structure, modifiability, etc.). Results: The various results obtained cover a wide spectrum: First, there are results that many people would have called “obvious” or “well known,” say, that Perl solutions tend to be more compact than Java solutions. Second, there are results that contradict conventional wisdom, say, that our PHP solutions appear in some (but not all) respects to be actually at least as secure as the others. Finally, one result makes a statement we have not seen discussed previously: Along several dimensions, the amount of within-platform variation between the teams tends to be smaller for PHP than for the other platforms. Conclusion: The results suggest that substantial characteristic platform differences do indeed exist in some dimensions, but possibly not in others.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.22","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5406528","Emergent properties;usability;functionality;reliability;security;product size;design structure;modifiability;Java;PHP;Perl.","Java;Computer languages;Usability;Security;Libraries;Programming profession;Product design;Buildings;Cascading style sheets;Ecosystems","emergent phenomena;Internet;Java;Perl;Web design","Web development platform;emergent platform properties;Web based applications;Java EE;Perl solutions;PHP solutions","","7","","26","","5 Feb 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, this is a potentially costly task. To mitigate the costs, the testing effort can be optimized by executing only a selected subset of the test cases that are believed to have a better chance of revealing faults. This paper proposes a novel approach for selecting and ordering a predetermined number of test cases from an existing test suite. Our approach forms an Integer Linear Programming problem using two different coverage-based criteria, and uses constraint relaxation to find many close-to-optimal solution points. These points are then combined to obtain a final solution using a voting mechanism. The selected subset of test cases is then prioritized using a greedy algorithm that maximizes minimum coverage in an iterative manner. The proposed approach has been empirically evaluated and the results show significant improvements over existing approaches for some cases and comparable results for the rest. Moreover, our approach provides more consistency compared to existing approaches.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.56","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5928351","Software regression testing;test case selection;integer programming;Pareto optimality","Testing;Software;Time factors;Fault detection;Optimization;Estimation;IP networks","greedy algorithms;integer programming;linear programming;program testing;regression analysis","size constrained regression test case selection;multicriteria optimization;modified software system;integer linear programming problem;voting mechanism;greedy algorithm;iterative manner","","39","","61","","23 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Shatnawi","Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid","IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","29 Mar 2010","2010","36","2","216","225","Object-oriented metrics have been validated empirically as measures of design complexity. These metrics can be used to mitigate potential problems in the software complexity. However, there are few studies that were conducted to formulate the guidelines, represented as threshold values, to interpret the complexity of the software design using metrics. Classes can be clustered into low and high risk levels using threshold values. In this paper, we use a statistical model, derived from the logistic regression, to identify threshold values for the Chidamber and Kemerer (CK) metrics. The methodology is validated empirically on a large open-source system-the Eclipse project. The empirical results indicate that the CK metrics have threshold effects at various risk levels. We have validated the use of these thresholds on the next release of the Eclipse project-Version 2.1-using decision trees. In addition, the selected threshold values were more accurate than those were selected based on either intuitive perspectives or on data distribution parameters. Furthermore, the proposed model can be exploited to find the risk level for an arbitrary threshold value. These findings suggest that there is a relationship between risk levels and object-oriented metrics and that risk levels can be used to identify threshold effects.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5383377","Object-oriented programming;product metrics;CK metrics;threshold values;open-source software.","Open source software;Object oriented modeling;Software metrics;Software quality;Software testing;Software design;Predictive models;Quality assurance;Probability;Fault diagnosis","decision trees;object-oriented programming;public domain software;software fault tolerance;software maintenance;software metrics;statistical analysis","object-oriented metrics;open source systems;software complexity;software design;software metrics;statistical model;logistic regression;Chidamber and Kemerer metrics;Eclipse project version 2.1;decision trees;threshold values;data distribution parameters","","70","","49","","15 Jan 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

They provide reusable concepts that are instantiated in application code through potentially complex implementation steps such as subclassing, implementing interfaces, and calling framework operations. Unfortunately, many modern frameworks are difficult to use because of their large and complex APIs and frequently incomplete user documentation. To cope with these problems, developers often use existing framework applications as a guide. However, locating concept implementations in those sample applications is typically challenging due to code tangling and scattering. To address this challenge, we introduce the notion of concept-implementation templates, which summarize the necessary concept-implementation steps and identify them in the sample application code, and a technique, named FUDA, to automatically extract such templates from dynamic traces of sample applications. This paper further presents the results of two experiments conducted to evaluate the quality and usefulness of FUDA templates. The experimental evaluation of FUDA with 14 concepts in five widely used frameworks suggests that the technique is effective in producing templates with relatively few false positives and false negatives for realistic concepts by using two sample applications. Moreover, we observed in a user study with 28 programmers that the use of templates reduced the concept-implementation time compared to when documentation was used.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.77","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5975174","Object-oriented application frameworks;framework comprehension;framework documentation;concept-implementation templates;application programming interface (API);dynamic analysis;concept location;feature identification","Dynamic programming;Feature extraction;Documentation;Java;Application programming interfaces;Runtime","application program interfaces;object-oriented methods","framework-usage template extraction;dynamic traces;object-oriented frameworks;application code;subclassing operation;interface implementation;calling framework operations;user documentation;code tangling;code scattering;concept-implementation templates;concept-implementation steps;FUDA templates;framework API understanding through dynamic analysis","","7","","68","","4 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The work presented here refines and complements many other studies in this research area in which such policies have been introduced and compared. This work has been performed by using the authors' testing framework for soft scheduling policies, which produces actual, synthetic, randomly generated applications, executes them in an instrumented Real-Time Operating System (RTOS), and finally processes this information to obtain several statistical outcomes. The results show that, in general, the presence of a significant amount of gain time reduces the performance benefit of the scheduling policies under study when compared to serving the soft tasks in background, which is considered the theoretical worst case. In some cases, this performance benefit is so small that the use of a specific scheduling policy for soft tasks is questionable.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.95","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6025357","Real-time systems;RT-Linux;scheduling policies","Real time systems;Servers;Time factors;Generators;Scheduling;Heuristic algorithms;Decision support systems","operating systems (computers);real-time systems;scheduling","gain time;soft-task scheduling policies;hard real-time systems;worst case execution time;WCET;processor consumption;representative scheduling algorithms;aperiodic tasks;fixed-priority preemptive systems;author testing framework;instrumented real-time operating system;RTOS;statistical outcomes","","3","","31","","23 Sep 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, voting systems are as important as other well-known critical systems, such as air traffic control systems or nuclear plant monitors. Unfortunately, voting systems have a history of failures that seems to indicate that their quality is not up to the task. Because of the alarming frequency and impact of the malfunctions of voting systems, in recent years a number of vulnerability analysis exercises have been carried out against voting systems to determine if they can be compromised in order to control the results of an election. We have participated in two such large-scale projects, sponsored by the Secretaries of State of California and Ohio, whose goals were to perform the security testing of the electronic voting systems used in their respective states. As the result of the testing process, we identified major vulnerabilities in all of the systems analyzed. We then took advantage of a combination of these vulnerabilities to generate a series of attacks that would spread across the voting systems and would “steal” votes by combining voting record tampering with social engineering approaches. As a response to the two large-scale security evaluations, the Secretaries of State of California and Ohio recommended changes to improve the security of the voting process. In this paper, we describe the methodology that we used in testing the two real-world electronic voting systems we evaluated, the findings of our analysis, our attacks, and the lessons we learned.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2009.53","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5210119","Voting systems;security testing;vulnerability analysis.","Electronic equipment testing;System testing;Security;Electronic voting systems;Large-scale systems;Government;Air traffic control;History;Frequency;Control systems","data privacy;government data processing;security of data","security testing;electronic voting system;alarming frequency;vulnerability analysis exercise;California;Ohio;social engineering approache;large scale security evaluation","","26","","62","","21 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper we report on the use of MDD on a significant real-world project over several years. Our research found the MDD approach to be deficient in terms of modelling architectural design rules. Furthermore, the current body of literature does not offer a satisfactory solution as to how architectural design rules should be modelled. As a result developers have to rely on time-consuming and error-prone manual practices to keep a system consistent with its architecture. To realise the full benefits of MDD it is important to find ways of formalizing architectural design rules which then allow automatic enforcement of the architecture on the system model.

This paper presents a design language and a tool suite covering the development life-cycle of a pervasive computing application. The design language allows us to define a taxonomy of area-specific building-blocks, abstracting over their heterogeneity. This language also includes a layer to define the architecture of an application, following an architectural pattern commonly used in the pervasive computing domain. Our underlying methodology assigns roles to the stakeholders, providing separation of concerns. Our tool suite includes a compiler that takes design artifacts written in our language as input and generates a programming framework that supports the subsequent development stages, namely, implementation, testing, and deployment.

Furthermore, we show that this metric correlates strongly with three measures of software quality: code changes, automated defect reports, and defect log messages. We measure these correlations on over 2.2 million lines of code, as well as longitudinally, over many releases of selected projects.

Starting from a set of preexisting test workloads, BURN finds a policy that interleaves their execution to stress the multitier application and generate controlled burstiness in resource consumption. This is useful to study, in a controlled way, the robustness of software services to sudden changes in the workload characteristics and in the usage levels of the resources. The problem is tackled by a model-based technique which first generates Markov models to describe resource consumption patterns of each test workload. Then, a policy is generated using an optimization program which sets as constraints a target request mix and user-specified levels of burstiness at the different resources in the system. Burstiness is quantified using a novel metric called overdemand, which describes in a natural way the tendency of a workload to keep a resource congested for long periods of time and across multiple requests. A case study based on a three-tier application testbed shows that our method is able to control and predict burstiness for session service demands at a fine-grained scale. Furthermore, experiments demonstrate that for any given request mix our approach can expose latency and throughput degradations not found with nonbursty workloads having the same request mix.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.58","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5928353","Benchmarking;performance;burstiness;bottleneck migration;overdemand","Benchmark testing;Markov processes;Servers;Aggregates;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Linear regression","benchmark testing;Markov processes","BURN;workload burstiness;customized service benchmarks;customized benchmarks;multitier application;time-varying resource usage condition;controlled burstiness;software services;model-based technique;Markov models;resource consumption pattern;optimization program;target request mix;user-specified levels;three-tier application testbed;session service demands;fine-grained scale;latency;throughput degradation;nonbursty workloads","","9","","38","","23 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Several techniques have been proposed to detect similar code fragments in software, so-called simple clones. Identification and subsequent unification of simple clones is beneficial in software maintenance. Even further gains can be obtained by elevating the level of code clone analysis. We observed that recurring patterns of simple clones often indicate the presence of interesting higher-level similarities that we call structural clones. Structural clones show a bigger picture of similarity situation than simple clones alone. Being logical groups of simple clones, structural clones alleviate the problem of huge number of clones typically reported by simple clone detection tools, a problem that is often dealt with postdetection visualization techniques. Detection of structural clones can help in understanding the design of the system for better maintenance and in reengineering for reuse, among other uses. In this paper, we propose a technique to detect some useful types of structural clones. The novelty of our approach includes the formulation of the structural clone concept and the application of data mining techniques to detect these higher-level similarities. We describe a tool called clone miner that implements our proposed technique. We assess the usefulness and scalability of the proposed techniques via several case studies. We discuss various usage scenarios to demonstrate in what ways the knowledge of structural clones adds value to the analysis based on simple clones alone.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2009.16","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796208","Design concepts;maintainability;restructuring;reverse engineering;reengineering;reusable software.","Data mining;Cloning;Software systems;Software maintenance;Collaboration;Portals;Computer Society;Visualization;Scalability;Reverse engineering","data mining;software maintenance;software reusability","data mining approach;higher-level clone detection;program structures;software system;software maintenance;code clone analysis;postdetection visualization techniques;software reusability","","64","1","53","","27 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is mainly because analyzing and transforming source code requires consideration of many language features that complicate program analysis, in particular intricate name lookup and access control rules. This paper introduces JL, a lookup-free, access control-free representation of Java programs. We present algorithms for translating Java programs into JL and vice versa, thereby making it possible to formulate refactorings entirely at the level of JL and to rely on the translations to take care of naming and accessibility issues. We demonstrate how complex refactorings become more robust and powerful when lifted to JL. Our approach has been implemented using the JastAddJ compiler framework, and evaluated by systematically performing two commonly used refactorings on an extensive suite of real-world Java applications. The evaluation shows that our tool correctly handles many cases where current refactoring tools fail to handle the complex rules for name binding and accessibility in Java.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2012.13","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6152131","Restructuring;reverse engineering;and reengineering;object-oriented languages;Java","Java;Access control;Feature extraction;Reverse engineering;Object oriented programming;Shadow mapping;Program processors","authorisation;Java;naming services;program compilers;program diagnostics;software maintenance","comprehensive approach;naming issues;accessibility issues;Java program refactoring;mainstream programming languages;source code analysis;source code transformation;language features;program analysis;name lookup;access control rules;JL;lookup-free access control-free representation;JastAddJ compiler framework","","14","","43","","14 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We then consider a class of systems whose transitions are governed by a Markov Chain-in this case, the set of states a system may be in is specified by the transitions of pmfs from all potential initial states to the final state. We then provide a model checking algorithm to check iLTL properties of such systems. Unlike existing model checking techniques, which either compute the portions of the computational paths that satisfy a specification or evaluate properties along a single path of pmf transitions, our model checking technique enables us to do a complete analysis on the expected behaviors of large-scale systems. Desirable system parameters may also be found as a counterexample of a negated goal.

In this paper, we address some of these challenges by defining and applying a new model of adaptive behavior called an Adaptation Finite-State Machine (A-FSM) to enable the detection of faults caused by both erroneous adaptation logic and asynchronous updating of context information, with the latter leading to inconsistencies between the external physical context and its internal representation within an application. We identify a number of adaptation fault patterns, each describing a class of faulty behaviors. Finally, we describe three classes of algorithms to detect such faults automatically via analysis of the A-FSM. We evaluate our approach and the trade-offs between the classes of algorithms on a set of synthetically generated Context-Aware Adaptive Applications (CAAAs) and on a simple but realistic application in which a cell phone's configuration profile changes automatically as a result of changes to the user's location, speed, and surrounding environment.

Model checking techniques have been proposed to compensate for the weaknesses of conventional testing methods through exhaustive analyses. Whereas conventional model checkers require manual effort to create an abstract target model, modern software model checkers remove this overhead by directly analyzing a target C program, and can be utilized as unit testing tools. However, since software model checkers are not fully mature yet, they have limitations according to the underlying technologies and tool implementations, potentially critical issues when applied in industrial projects.

The originality of DETEX stems from the ability for software engineers to specify smells at a high level of abstraction using a consistent vocabulary and domain-specific language for automatically generating detection algorithms. Using DETEX, we specify four well-known design smells: the antipatterns Blob, Functional Decomposition, Spaghetti Code, and Swiss Army Knife, and their 15 underlying code smells, and we automatically generate their detection algorithms. We apply and validate the detection algorithms in terms of precision and recall on XERCES v2.7.0, and discuss the precision of these algorithms on 11 open-source systems.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2009.50","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5196681","Antipatterns;design smells;code smells;specification;metamodeling;detection;Java.","Detection algorithms;Vocabulary;Domain specific languages;Algorithm design and analysis;Metamodeling;Java;Design engineering;Object oriented programming;Phase detection;Costs","formal specification;program verification;software quality","code specification;code detection;design smells;DECOR;DETEX;antipatterns Blob;functional decomposition;Spaghetti code;Swiss army knife;empirical validation;domain-specific language;open-source systems","","364","","66","","7 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To avoid failures due to the updating process itself, many DSU systems employ timing restrictions. However, timing restrictions are theoretically imperfect, and their practical effectiveness is an open question. This paper presents the first significant empirical evaluation of three popular timing restrictions: activeness safety (AS), which prevents updates to active functions, con-freeness safety (CFS), which only allows modifications to active functions when doing so is provably type-safe, and manual identification of the event-handling loops during which an update may occur. We evaluated these timing restrictions using a series of DSU patches to three programs: OpenSSH, vsftpd, and ngIRCd. We systematically applied updates at each distinct update point reached during execution of a suite of system tests for these programs to determine which updates pass and which fail. We found that all three timing restrictions prevented most failures, but only manual identification allowed none. Further, although CFS and AS allowed many more update points, manual identification still supported updates with minimal delay. Finally, we found that manual identification required the least developer effort. Overall, we conclude that manual identification is most effective.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6035725","Dynamic software updating (DSU);hot-swapping;software reliability;testing;program tracing","Software reliability;Software testing;Servers","program testing;safety-critical software;software fault tolerance;software maintenance","dynamic software updating safety evaluation;systematic testing;DSU systems;timing restrictions;activeness safety;AS;active functions;con-freeness safety;CFS;event-handling loop identification;OpenSSH;vsftpd;ngIRCd;manual identification;failure prevention","","18","2","35","","6 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

If the model is a Markov chain, these are expressed as real functions of the chain, called reward models. The computational complexity of reward-based metrics is of the same order as the solution of the Markov chain, making the analysis infeasible when evaluating large-scale systems. In the context of the stochastic process algebra PEPA, the underlying continuous-time Markov chain has been shown to admit a deterministic (fluid) approximation as a solution of an ordinary differential equation, which effectively circumvents state-space explosion. This paper is concerned with approximating Markovian reward models for PEPA with fluid rewards, i.e., functions of the solution of the differential equation problem. It shows that (1) the Markovian reward models for typical metrics of performance enjoy asymptotic convergence to their fluid analogues, and that (2) via numerical tests, the approximation yields satisfactory accuracy in practice.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.81","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5975178","Modeling and prediction;ordinary differential equations;Markov processes","Convergence;Markov processes;Approximation methods;Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Servers","computational complexity;Markov processes;mathematics computing;process algebra;stochastic processes","fluid rewards;stochastic process algebra;software systems;metric derivation;Markov chain;computational complexity;ordinary differential equation;state-space explosion","","19","","33","","4 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

On the one hand, we find a strong correlation between dependency and cochange. Furthermore, we provide empirical evidence for the propagation of change along paths of dependency. These findings support the often alleged role of dependencies as propagators of change. On the other hand, we find that approximately half of all dependencies are never involved in cochanges and that the vast majority of cochanges pertain to only a small percentage of dependencies. This means that inferring the cochange characteristics of a software architecture solely from its dependency structure results in a severely distorted approximation of cochange characteristics. Any metric which uses dependencies alone to pass judgment on the evolvability of a piece of Java software is thus unreliable. As a consequence, we suggest to always take both the change characteristics and the dependency structure into account when evaluating software architecture.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.91","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6363462","Modularity;class dependency;open source","Software development;Java;Open source software","Java;software architecture","class dependency;change propagation;Java software;cochange characteristic;software architecture","","13","","48","","29 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moving state and behavior between classes can help reduce coupling and increase cohesion, but it is nontrivial to identify where such refactorings should be applied. In this paper, we propose a methodology for the identification of Move Method refactoring opportunities that constitute a way for solving many common feature envy bad smells. An algorithm that employs the notion of distance between system entities (attributes/methods) and classes extracts a list of behavior-preserving refactorings based on the examination of a set of preconditions. In practice, a software system may exhibit such problems in many different places. Therefore, our approach measures the effect of all refactoring suggestions based on a novel entity placement metric that quantifies how well entities have been placed in system classes. The proposed methodology can be regarded as a semi-automatic approach since the designer will eventually decide whether a suggested refactoring should be applied or not based on conceptual or other design quality criteria. The evaluation of the proposed approach has been performed considering qualitative, metric, conceptual, and efficiency aspects of the suggested refactorings in a number of open-source projects.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2009.1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4752842","Move Method refactoring;Feature Envy;object-oriented design;Jaccard distance;design quality.","Software systems;Performance evaluation;Open source software;Runtime;Productivity;Data mining","object-oriented programming;software maintenance;software metrics","Move Method refactoring opportunity identification;object-oriented system;conceptual criteria;software metrics;feature envy","","188","","33","","19 Jan 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The modeling of software assets that together form the actual products is critical for achieving the strategic benefits of Software Product Lines (SPLs). We propose a feature-based approach to software asset modeling based on abstractions provided by Domain-Specific Kits (DSKs). This approach involves a software Asset Metamodel (AMM) used to derive Asset Modeling Languages (AMLs) that define reusable software assets in domain-specific terms. The approach also prescribes a roadmap for modeling these software assets in conjunction with the product line reference architecture. Asset capabilities can be modeled using feature diagrams as the external views of the software assets. Internal views can be expressed in terms of Domain-Specific Artifacts (DSAs) with Variability Points (VPs), where the domain-specific artifacts are created using Domain-Specific Kits. This approach produces loosely coupled and highly cohesive software assets that are reusable for multiple product lines. The approach is validated by assessing software asset reuse in two different product lines in the finance domain. We also evaluated the productivity gains in large-scale complex projects, and found that the approach yielded a significant reduction in the total project effort.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6065739","Asset modeling;domain-specific kits;feature models;reuse;software asset;software product lines","Software reliability;Computer architecture;Productivity;Programming;Complexity theory;Systematics","financial data processing;product development;project management;simulation languages;software reusability","product line software asset modelling;domain-specific kits;software product line engineering;SPLE;product line core assets;feature-based approach;DSK;software asset metamodel;AMM;asset modeling languages;AML;software asset reusability;domain-specific terms;product line reference architecture;feature diagrams;internal views;domain-specific artifacts;DSA;variability points;VP;finance domain;productivity gains;large-scale complex projects","","5","","86","","1 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Measuring the Discriminative Power of Object-Oriented Class Cohesion Metrics","J. Al Dallal","Kuwait University, Kuwait","IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","5 Dec 2011","2011","37","6","788","804","Several object-oriented cohesion metrics have been proposed in the literature. These metrics aim to measure the relationship between class members, namely, methods and attributes. Different metrics use different models to represent the connectivity pattern of cohesive interactions (CPCI) between class members. Most of these metrics are normalized to allow for easy comparison of the cohesion of different classes. However, in some cases, these metrics obtain the same cohesion values for different classes that have the same number of methods and attributes but different CPCIs. This leads to incorrectly considering the classes to be the same in terms of cohesion, even though their CPCIs clearly indicate that the degrees of cohesion are different. We refer to this as a lack of discrimination anomaly (LDA) problem. In this paper, we list and discuss cases in which the LDA problem exists, as expressed through the use of 16 cohesion metrics. In addition, we empirically study the frequent occurrence of the LDA problem when the considered metrics are applied to classes in five open source Java systems. Finally, we propose a metric and a simulation-based methodology to measure the discriminative power of cohesion metrics. The discrimination metric measures the probability that a cohesion metric will produce distinct cohesion values for classes with the same number of attributes and methods but different CPCIs. A highly discriminating cohesion metric is more desirable because it exhibits a lower chance of incorrectly considering classes to be cohesively equal when they have different CPCIs.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.97","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5639020","Cohesive interactions;connectivity pattern;discrimination metric;discriminative power;lack of discrimination anomaly;object-oriented class cohesion.","Power measurement;Object oriented modeling;Software measurement;Phase measurement","Java;laser Doppler anemometry;object-oriented methods;public domain software","discriminative power measurement;object oriented class cohesion metrics;cohesive interactions;discrimination anomaly;open source Java systems;simulation based methodology","","33","","41","","18 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, a large number of DW initiatives end up as failures. In this paper, we argue that the maturity of a data warehousing process (DWP) could significantly mitigate such large-scale failures and ensure the delivery of consistent, high quality, “single-version of truth” data in a timely manner. However, unlike software development, the assessment of DWP maturity has not yet been tackled in a systematic way. In light of the critical importance of data as a corporate resource, we believe that the need for a maturity model for DWP could not be greater. In this paper, we describe the design and development of a five-level DWP maturity model (DWP-M) over a period of three years. A unique aspect of this model is that it covers processes in both data warehouse development and operations. Over 20 key DW executives from 13 different corporations were involved in the model development process. The final model was evaluated by a panel of experts; the results strongly validate the functionality, productivity, and usability of the model. We present the initial and final DWP-M model versions, along with illustrations of several key process areas at different levels of maturity.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5680911","Data warehousing process;design-science research;model validation;software maturity models.","Data warehouses;Business;Warehousing;Software;Programming;Data mining;Standards organizations","data warehouses","data warehousing process maturity;data warehouse market;large-scale failures;DWP-M model","","28","","75","","6 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We extend DBM equivalence classes with a density-function which provides a measure for the probability of individual states. To this end, we extend time Petri nets by associating a probability density-function to the static firing interval of each nondeterministic transition. We then explain how this stochastic information induces a probability distribution for the states contained within a DBM class and how this probability evolves in the enumeration of the reachability relation among classes. This enables the construction of a stochastic transition system which supports correctness verification based on the theory of TPNs, provides a measure of probability for each feasible run, enables steady-state analysis based on Markov renewal theory. In so doing, we provide a means to identify feasible behaviors and to associate them with a measure of probability in models with multiple concurrent generally distributed nondeterministic timers.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2009.36","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5010440","Correctness verification;performance and dependability evaluation;stochastic Time Petri nets;non-Markovian Stochastic Petri Nets;dense-time state-space analysis;Difference Bounds Matrix;Markov Renewal Theory.","Stochastic systems;Stochastic processes;Petri nets;Delay;Clocks;Timing;Density functional theory;Concurrent computing;Computer Society;Cost accounting","equivalence classes;Markov processes;matrix algebra;Petri nets;program verification;reachability analysis;statistical distributions","stochastic state-space class analysis;dense-time reactive system verification;quantitative evaluation;nondeterministic densely-valued temporal parameter;equivalence class;discrete logical location;difference bound matrix;DBM;reachability relation;qualitative correctness verification;event ordering;stimulus/response deadline;stochastic timed Petri net;probability density distribution function measure;static firing interval;nondeterministic transition;stochastic transition system;STPN theory;Markov renewal theory;nondeterministic timer","","44","","43","","29 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This facilitates the design of dynamic applications, but also impacts negatively on their verification, making it difficult to reason on the overall federation of components. In addition, existing P/S infrastructures offer radically different features to the applications, e.g., in terms of message reliability. This further complicates the verification as its outcome depends on the specific guarantees provided by the underlying P/S system. Although model checking has been proposed as a tool for the verification of P/S architectures, existing solutions overlook many characteristics of the underlying communication infrastructure to avoid state explosion problems. To overcome these limitations, the Loupe domain-specific model checker adopts a different approach. The P/S infrastructure is not modeled on top of a general-purpose model checker. Instead, it is embedded within the checking engine, and the traditional P/S operations become part of the modeling language. In this paper, we describe Loupe's design and the dedicated state abstractions that enable accurate verification without incurring state explosion problems. We also illustrate our use of state-of-the-art software verification tools to assess some key functionality in Loupe's current implementation. A complete case study shows how Loupe eases the verification of P/S architectures. Finally, we quantitatively compare Loupe's performance against alternative approaches.

To achieve atomicity, a service composition should satisfy the atomicity sphere, a structural criterion for the backend processes of involved services. Existing analysis techniques for atomicity sphere generally assume complete knowledge of all involved backend processes. Such an assumption is invalid when some service providers do not release all details of their backend processes to service consumers outside the organizations. To address this problem, we propose a process algebraic framework to publish atomicity-equivalent public views from the backend processes. These public views extract relevant task properties and reveal only partial process details that service providers need to expose. Our framework enables the analysis of atomicity sphere for service compositions using these public views instead of their backend processes. This allows service consumers to choose suitable services such that their composition satisfies the atomicity sphere without disclosing the details of their backend processes. Based on the theoretical result, we present algorithms to construct atomicity-equivalent public views and to analyze the atomicity sphere for a service composition. Two case studies from supply chain and insurance domains are given to evaluate our proposal and demonstrate the applicability of our approach.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2008.86","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4641941","Analysis;Specification;Software and System Safety;System integration and implementation;Formal methods;Model checking;Validation;Analysis;Specification;Software and System Safety;System integration and implementation;Formal methods;Model checking;Validation","Web services;Privacy;System recovery;Supply chains;Protection;Application software;Algorithm design and analysis;Insurance;Algebra;Internet","process algebra;Web services","atomicity sphere analysis;Web service composition;backend process;process algebraic framework;atomicity-equivalent public view;supply chain;insurance","","22","","76","","10 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The key motivation of using combinatorial techniques is that they enable us to incorporate “context” into the criteria in terms of event combinations, sequence length, and by including all possible positions for each event. Our new criteria range in both efficiency (measured by the size of the test suite) and effectiveness (the ability of the test suites to detect faults). In a case study on eight applications, we automatically generate test cases and systematically explore the impact of context, as captured by our new criteria. Our study shows that by increasing the event combinations tested and by controlling the relative positions of events defined by the new criteria, we can detect a large number of faults that were undetectable by earlier techniques.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.50","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5444885","GUI testing;automated testing;model-based testing;combinatorial interaction testing;GUITAR testing system.","Graphical user interfaces;System testing;Software testing;Automatic testing;Fault detection;Context modeling;Computer science;Software performance;Logic testing;User interfaces","automatic test pattern generation;graphical user interfaces;program testing","GUI interaction testing;graphical user interface;event driven nature;combinatorial interaction testing;automatic test case generation","","88","4","44","","8 Apr 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Directed explicit state-space search algorithms explore the state space on-the-fly, which makes our method very efficient and highly scalable. They can also be guided using heuristics which usually improve the performance of the method. Counterexamples provided by our method have two important properties. First, they include those traces which contribute the greatest amount of probability to the property violation. Hence, they show the most probable offending execution scenarios of the system. Second, the obtained counterexamples tend to be small. Hence, they can be effectively analyzed by a human user. Both properties make the counterexamples obtained by our method very useful for debugging purposes.

From an UML-based architectural design, an executable prototype is automatically created.

This issue is particularly severe for security-related concerns: It is difficult to be confident about the security of an application when the implementation of its security-related concerns is scattered all over the code and tangled with other concerns, making global reasoning about security precarious. In this study, we consider the case of access control in Java, which turns out to be a crosscutting concern with a nonmodular implementation based on runtime stack inspection. We describe the process of modularizing access control in Java by means of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP). We first show a solution based on AspectJ, the most popular aspect-oriented extension to Java, that must rely on a separate automata infrastructure. We then put forward a novel solution via dynamic deployment of aspects and scoping strategies. Both solutions, apart from providing a modular specification of access control, make it possible to easily express other useful policies such as the Chinese wall policy. However, relying on expressive scope control results in a compact implementation, which, at the same time, permits the straightforward expression of even more interesting policies. These new modular implementations allowed by AOP alleviate maintenance and evolution issues produced by the crosscutting nature of access control.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5680915","Programming languages;security;aspect-oriented programming;access control.","Aspect-oriented programming;Access control;Computer architecture;Java;Programming;Computer security","aspect-oriented programming;authorisation;automata theory;Java","Java access control aspectization;code scattering;code tangling;security-related concerns;runtime stack inspection;aspect-oriented programming;AspectJ;automata infrastructure;aspects strategies;scoping strategies;Chinese wall policy","","6","","45","","6 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Closed models are important for performance evaluation of multitier applications, but when the number of service classes is large, they become too expensive to solve with exact methods such as mean value analysis (MVA). CoMoM addresses this limitation by a new recursion that scales efficiently with the number of classes. Compared to the MVA algorithm, which recursively computes mean queue lengths, CoMoM also carries on in the recursion information on higher-order moments of queue lengths. We show that this additional information greatly reduces the number of operations needed to solve the model and makes CoMoM the best-available algorithm for networks with several classes. We conclude the paper by generalizing CoMoM to the efficient computation of marginal queue-length probabilities, which finds application in the evaluation of state-dependent attributes such as quality-of-service metrics.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2008.79","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4641939","Performance of Systems;Modeling techniques;Queuing theory;Performance of Systems;Modeling techniques;Queuing theory","Performance analysis;Moment methods;Quality of service;Queueing analysis;Network servers;Computer networks;Capacity planning;Web server;Transaction databases;Algorithm design and analysis","method of moments;probability;quality of service;queueing theory","class-oriented method of moment;closed multiclass queueing network;marginal queue-length probability;performance evaluation;multitier application;mean value analysis;higher-order moment;J2EE application;state-dependent index evaluation;energy consumption;quality-of-service metrics","","6","","24","","10 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately, concurrent programs are prone to bugs. Among different types of concurrency bugs, atomicity violations are common and important. How to test the interleaving space and expose atomicity-violation bugs is an open problem. This paper makes three contributions. First, it designs and evaluates a hierarchy of four interleaving coverage criteria using 105 real-world concurrency bugs. This study finds a coverage criterion (Unserializable Interleaving Coverage) that balances the complexity and the capability of exposing atomicity-violation bugs well. Second, it studies stress testing to understand why this common practice cannot effectively expose atomicity-violation bugs from the perspective of unserializable interleaving coverage. Third, it designs CTrigger following the unserializable interleaving coverage criterion. CTrigger uses trace analysis to identify feasible unserializable interleavings, and then exercises low-probability interleavings to expose atomicity-violation bugs. We evaluate CTrigger with real-world atomicity-violation bugs from seven applications. CTrigger efficiently exposes these bugs within 1-235 seconds, two to four orders of magnitude faster than stress testing. Without CTrigger, some of these bugs do not manifest even after seven days of stress testing. Furthermore, once a bug is exposed, CTrigger can reliably reproduce it, usually within 5 seconds, for diagnosis.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.35","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5740930","Testing and debugging;debugging aids;diagnostics;testing strategies;test coverage of code;concurrent programming;bug characteristics","Computer bugs;Testing;Instruction sets;Concurrent computing;Stress;Complexity theory;Synchronization","formal verification;multiprocessing systems;probability;program debugging;ubiquitous computing","finding atomicity violation bugs;unserializable interleaving testing;multicore hardware;pervasive concurrent programs;concurrency bugs;unserializable interleaving coverage;trace analysis;low probability interleavings","","17","","48","","5 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This work provides the first single model that is generic enough to study GUI and Web applications together. In this paper, we use the model to define generic prioritization criteria that are applicable to both GUI and Web applications. Our ultimate goal is to evolve the model and use it to develop a unified theory of how all EDS should be tested. An empirical study reveals that the GUI and Web-based applications, when recast using the new model, show similar behavior. For example, a criterion that gives priority to all pairs of event interactions did well for GUI and Web applications; another criterion that gives priority to the smallest number of parameter value settings did poorly for both. These results reinforce our belief that these two subclasses of applications should be modeled and studied together.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5401169","Combinatorial interaction testing;covering arrays;event-driven software (EDS);t-way interaction coverage;test suite prioritization;user-session testing;Web application testing;GUI testing.","Software testing;Graphical user interfaces;Application software;Computer science;User interfaces;Protocols;Embedded software;Information systems;Educational institutions;Abstracts","graphical user interfaces;Internet;program testing;service-oriented architecture","event-driven software;test prioritization strategy;EDS;GUI testing;Web application testing;graphical user interface","","72","1","28","","29 Jan 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Building upon the pi-calculus model checker MMC, we first show an automated procedure for constructing the underlying semantic model of a probabilistic or stochastic pi-calculus process. This can then be verified using existing probabilistic model checkers such as PRISM.

We observe that conventional persistence techniques usually do not consider the application contexts of the persistence operations, where not all of the object states need to be persisted. Leveraging this observation, we have designed and implemented a framework called Pert, which first performs static program analysis to estimate the actual usage of the persisted object, given the context of its usage in the program.

However, this problem has not been well studied. This paper investigates the problem for component-based software systems from three points of view. First, the whole spectrum of QoS characteristics is defined. Second, the logical and physical requirements for QoS characteristics are analyzed and solutions to achieve them are proposed. Third, prior work is classified by QoS characteristics and then realized by abstract reconfiguration strategies. On this basis, quantitative evaluation of the QoS assurance abilities of existing work and our own approach is conducted through three steps. First, a proof-of-concept prototype called the reconfigurable component model is implemented to support the representation and testing of the reconfiguration strategies. Second, a reconfiguration benchmark is proposed to expose the whole spectrum of QoS problems. Third, each reconfiguration strategy is tested against the benchmark and the testing results are evaluated. The most important conclusion from our investigation is that the classified QoS characteristics can be fully achieved under some acceptable constraints.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.37","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5740932","Change management;componentware;dynamic reconfiguration;modeling the QoS assurance process;system evolution.","Quality of service;Encryption;Protocols;Connectors;Receivers;Benchmark testing","quality of service;software quality","QoS assurance;dynamic reconfiguration;component based software systems;Quality of Service;application disruption;physical requirements;logical requirements;abstract reconfiguration;quantitative evaluation;reconfigurable component;reconfiguration benchmark","","21","","39","","5 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We replace crosscutting concerns with aspects in three industrial applications to examine the effects on qualities that affect the maintainability of the applications. We study several revisions of each application, identifying crosscutting concerns in the initial revision and also crosscutting concerns that are added in later revisions.

Counterexamples of smallest size that deviate most from the required probability bound can be obtained by applying (small amendments to) k-shortest (hop-constrained) paths algorithms. These results can be extended to Markov chains with rewards, to LTL model checking, and are useful for Markov decision processes. Experimental results show that typically the size of a counterexample is excessive. To obtain much more compact representations, we present a simple algorithm to generate (minimal) regular expressions that can act as counterexamples.

Reusing such gray-box components can result in integration faults that can be difficult to diagnose and locate. In this paper, we present Behavior Capture and Test (BCT), a technique that uses dynamic analysis to automatically identify the causes of failures and locate the related faults. BCT augments dynamic analysis techniques with model-based monitoring. In this way, BCT identifies a structured set of interactions and data values that are likely related to failures (failure causes), and indicates the components and the operations that are likely responsible for failures (fault locations). BCT advances scientific knowledge in several ways. It combines classic dynamic analysis with incremental finite state generation techniques to produce dynamic models that capture complementary aspects of component interactions. It uses an effective technique to filter false positives to reduce the effort of the analysis of the produced data. It defines a strategy to extract information about likely causes of failures by automatically ranking and relating the detected anomalies so that developers can focus their attention on the faults. The effectiveness of BCT depends on the quality of the dynamic models extracted from the program. BCT is particularly effective when the test cases sample the execution space well. In this paper, we present a set of case studies that illustrate the adequacy of BCT to analyze both regression testing failures and rare field failures. The results show that BCT automatically filters out most of the false alarms and provides useful information to understand the causes of failures in 69 percent of the case studies.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.93","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5611554","Dynamic Analysis;diagnosis;fault localization;false positive filters;regression failure analysis;field failure analysis.","Automata;Monitoring;Analytical models;Engines;Software;Testing;Inference algorithms","fault diagnosis;object-oriented programming;program testing;software fault tolerance","software components;Integration Faults;behavior capture and test technique;BCT;dynamic analysis;model-based monitoring;incremental finite state generation techniques","","54","","71","","28 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To measure tool usage, we randomly sampled code changes from four Eclipse and eight Mylyn developers and ascertained, for each refactoring, if it was performed manually or with tool support. We found that refactoring tools are seldom used: 11 percent by Eclipse developers and 9 percent by Mylyn developers. To understand refactoring practice at large, we drew from a variety of data sets spanning more than 39,000 developers, 240,000 tool-assisted refactorings, 2,500 developer hours, and 12,000 version control commits. Using these data, we cast doubt on several previously stated assumptions about how programmers refactor, while validating others.

Unlike conventional exception handling on functional failures, nonfunctional QoS failures such as temporal violations cannot be passively recovered. They need to be proactively prevented through dynamically monitoring and adjusting the temporal consistency states of scientific workflows at runtime. However, current research on workflow temporal verification mainly focuses on runtime monitoring, while the adjusting strategy for temporal consistency states, namely, temporal adjustment, has so far not been thoroughly investigated. For this issue, two fundamental problems of temporal adjustment, namely, where and how, are systematically analyzed and addressed in this paper. Specifically, a novel minimum probability time redundancy-based necessary and sufficient adjustment point selection strategy is proposed to address the problem of where and an innovative genetic-algorithm-based effective and efficient local rescheduling strategy is proposed to tackle the problem of how. The results of large-scale simulation experiments with generic workflows and specific real-world applications demonstrate that our temporal adjustment strategy can remarkably prevent the violations of both local and global temporal constraints in scientific workflows.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.99","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5645643","Workflow management;exception handling;reliability;software verification;statistical methods.","Decision support systems;Software reliability;Quality of service;Workflow management software","genetic algorithms;middleware;quality of service;workflow management software","temporal violation prevention;scientific workflows;grid computing;cloud computing;nonfunctional QoS failures;workflow temporal verification;adjustment point selection;rescheduling strategy;generic workflows","","39","","53","","29 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We performed a systematic literature review (SLR) of empirical studies that investigated factors affecting the effectiveness of PP for CS/SE students and studies that measured the effectiveness of PP for CS/SE students. Seventy-four papers were used in our synthesis of evidence, and 14 compatibility factors that can potentially affect PP's effectiveness as a pedagogical tool were identified. Results showed that students' skill level was the factor that affected PP's effectiveness the most. The most common measure used to gauge PP's effectiveness was time spent on programming. In addition, students' satisfaction when using PP was overall higher than when working solo. Our meta-analyses showed that PP was effective in improving students' grades on assignments. Finally, in the studies that used quality as a measure of effectiveness, the number of test cases succeeded, academic performance, and expert opinion were the quality measures mostly applied. The results of this SLR show two clear gaps in this research field: 1) a lack of studies focusing on pair compatibility factors aimed at making PP an effective pedagogical tool and 2) a lack of studies investigating PP for software design/modeling tasks in conjunction with programming tasks.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.59","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5482588","Empirical studies;pair programming;systematic review.","Programming profession;Education;Educational programs;Computer science;Performance evaluation;Time measurement;Testing;Software design;Collaborative work;Algorithm design and analysis","educational technology;further education;software prototyping;teaching","pair programming;CS/SE teaching;higher education;systematic literature review;PP","","135","","75","","7 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Yet, designers rarely benefit from such an instant feedback in modeling tools. This paper focuses on the refinement of UML-style class models with instant feedback on correctness. Following the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) paradigm, we strongly believe in the benefit of maintaining high-level and low-level models separately to 1) document the lower level model and 2) continuously ensure the correctness of the low-level model during later evolution (i.e., high- or low-level models may be evolved independently). However, currently the refinement and subsequent evolution lack automated support, let alone an instant feedback on their correctness (i.e., consistency). Traditional approaches to consistency checking fail here because of the computational cost of comparing class models. Our proposed instant approach first transforms the low-level model into an intermediate model that is then easier comparable with the high-level model. The key to computational scalability is the separation of transformation and comparison so that each can react optimally to changes-changes that could happen concurrently in both the high- and low-level class models. We evaluate our approach on eight third-party design models. The empirical data show that the separation of transformation and comparison results in a 6 to 11-fold performance gain and a ninefold reduction in producing irrelevant feedback. While this work emphasizes the refinement of class models, we do believe that the concepts are more generally applicable to other kinds of modeling languages, where transformation and subsequent comparison are computationally expensive.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2009.26","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4815278","Class models;consistency checking;refinement;separation of concerns;and UML.","Feedback;Programming profession;Unified modeling language;Software systems;Error correction;Computational efficiency;Concurrent computing;Scalability;Performance gain;System recovery","software architecture;Unified Modeling Language","class model refinement;integrated development environment;UML-style class models;Unified Modeling Language;model-driven architecture;computational scalability","","8","","43","","17 Apr 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most applications perform expensive stack walking to recover contexts. The resulting contexts are often explicitly represented as a sequence of call sites and hence are bulky. We propose a technique to encode the current calling context of any point during an execution. In particular, an acyclic call path is encoded into one number through only integer additions. Recursive call paths are divided into acyclic subsequences and encoded independently. We leverage stack depth in a safe way to optimize encoding: If a calling context can be safely and uniquely identified by its stack depth, we do not perform encoding. We propose an algorithm to seamlessly fuse encoding and stack depth-based identification. The algorithm is safe because different contexts are guaranteed to have different IDs. It also ensures contexts can be faithfully decoded. Our experiments show that our technique incurs negligible overhead (0-6.4 percent). For most medium-sized programs, it can encode all contexts with just one number. For large programs, we are able to encode most calling contexts to a few numbers. We also present our experience of applying context encoding to debugging crash-based failures.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.70","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5963696","Calling context;context sensitivity;profiling;path encoding;calling context encoding;call graph","Context;Encoding;Instruments;Image edge detection;Runtime;Decoding;Software algorithms","optimisation;program compilers;program debugging","precise calling context encoding;CC;profiling;event logging;stack walking;context recovery;call sites;recursive call paths;acyclic subsequences;encoding optimization;stack depth-based identification;ID;medium-sized programs;crash-based failure debugging","","12","","54","","28 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper reports on a study of the impact of the Big Five personality traits on the performance of pair programmers together with the impact of expertise and task complexity. The study involved 196 software professionals in three countries forming 98 pairs. The analysis consisted of a confirmatory part and an exploratory part. The results show that: (1) Our data do not confirm a meta-analysis-based model of the impact of certain personality traits on performance and (2) personality traits, in general, have modest predictive value on pair programming performance compared with expertise, task complexity, and country. We conclude that more effort should be spent on investigating other performance-related predictors such as expertise, and task complexity, as well as other promising predictors, such as programming skill and learning. We also conclude that effort should be spent on elaborating on the effects of personality on various measures of collaboration, which, in turn, may be used to predict and influence performance.

As the functionality is provided by a set of dynamically composed distributed services, in order to achieve a management objective multiple operations have to be applied over the distributed elements of the managed infrastructure. Moreover, the manager must cope with the highly heterogeneous characteristics and management interfaces of the runtime resources. With this in mind, this paper proposes to support the configuration and deployment of services with an automated closed control loop. The automation is enabled by the definition of a generic information model, which captures all the information relevant to the management of the services with the same abstractions, describing the runtime elements, service dependencies, and business objectives. On top of that, a technique based on satisfiability is described which automatically diagnoses the state of the managed environment and obtains the required changes for correcting it (e.g., installation, service binding, update, or configuration).

Two studies on eight applications demonstrate that the feedback-based technique 1) is able to significantly improve existing techniques and helps identify serious problems in the software and 2) the ESI relationships captured via GUI state yield test suites that most often detect more faults than their code, event, and event-interaction-coverage equivalent counterparts.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2009.68","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5306073","GUI testing;automated testing;model-based testing;GUITAR testing system.","Graphical user interfaces;Runtime;State feedback;Automatic testing;Software testing;System testing;Application software;Costs;Fault diagnosis;Event detection","graphical user interfaces;program testing;software quality","event sequence based test cases;graphical user interfaces;GUI runtime state feedback;automatic model driven technique;event interaction coverage equivalent counterparts;software quality;event semantic interaction relationships","","70","2","49","","30 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The definition of stochastic temporal logics like continuous stochastic logic (CSL) and its variant asCSL, and of their model-checking algorithms, allows a unified approach to the verification of systems, allowing the mix of performance evaluation and probabilistic verification. In this paper we present the stochastic logic CSLTA, which is more expressive than CSL and asCSL, and in which properties can be specified using automata (more precisely, timed automata with a single clock). The extension with respect to expressiveness allows the specification of properties referring to the probability of a finite sequence of timed events. A typical example is the responsiveness property ""with probability at least 0.75, a message sent at time 0 by a system A will be received before time 5 by system B and the acknowledgment will be back at A before time 7"", a property that cannot be expressed in either CSL or asCSL.

However, detailed studies based on empirical data are rare. In this paper, we analyze the fault and failure data from two large, real-world case studies. Specifically, we explore: 1) the localization of faults that lead to individual software failures and 2) the distribution of different types of software faults. Our results show that individual failures are often caused by multiple faults spread throughout the system. This observation is important since it does not support several heuristics and assumptions used in the past. In addition, it clearly indicates that finding and fixing faults that lead to such software failures in large, complex systems are often difficult and challenging tasks despite the advances in software development. Our results also show that requirement faults, coding faults, and data problems are the three most common types of software faults. Furthermore, these results show that contrary to the popular belief, a significant percentage of failures are linked to late life cycle activities. Another important aspect of our work is that we conduct intra- and interproject comparisons, as well as comparisons with the findings from related studies. The consistency of several main trends across software systems in this paper and several related research efforts suggests that these trends are likely to be intrinsic characteristics of software faults and failures rather than project specific.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2009.3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4760152","Software faults and failures;fault location;fault types;software fault distribution;software reliability;empirical studies.","Failure analysis;Software quality;Programming;Software systems;Fault location;Software reliability;Fault detection;Humans;Terminology;Computer bugs","software fault tolerance;system recovery;systems analysis","software fault analysis;software failure data;complex system;software development;requirement fault;coding fault;software life cycle activity;software system","","67","","26","","23 Jan 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing standards usually assign predefined risk levels to components in the design phase, to provide some guidelines for the verification. It is a rough-grained assignment that does not consider the costs and does not provide sufficient modeling basis to let engineers quantitatively optimize resources usage. Software reliability allocation models partially address such issues, but they usually make so many assumptions on the input parameters that their application is difficult in practice. In this paper, we try to reduce this gap, proposing a reliability and testing resources allocation model that is able to provide solutions at various levels of detail, depending upon the information the engineer has about the system. The model aims to quantitatively identify the most critical components of software architecture in order to best assign the testing resources to them. A tool for the solution of the model is also developed. The model is applied to an empirical case study, a program developed for the European Space Agency, to verify model's prediction abilities and evaluate the impact of the parameter estimation errors on the prediction accuracy.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5383374","Reliability;software architecture;software testing.","Software reliability;Software testing;Reliability engineering;Predictive models;Software systems;Guidelines;Cost function;Application software;System testing;Resource management","program testing;software architecture;software reliability","software reliability;testing time allocation;architecture-based approach;rough-grained assignment","","48","","40","","15 Jan 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There are patches and upgrades that close vulnerabilities, fix bugs, and evolve software with new features. Unfortunately, most traditional dynamic software updating approaches suffer some level of limitations; few of them can update multithreaded applications when involving data structure changes, while some of them lose binary compatibility or incur nonnegligible performance overhead. This paper presents POLUS, a software maintenance tool capable of iteratively evolving running unmodified multithreaded software into newer versions, yet with very low performance overhead. The main idea in POLUS is a relaxed consistency model that permits the concurrent activity of the old and new code. POLUS borrows the idea of cache-coherence protocol in computer architecture and uses a ”bidirectional write-through” synchronization protocol to ensure system consistency. To demonstrate the applicability of POLUS, we report our experience in using POLUS to dynamically update three prevalent server applications: vsftpd, sshd, and Apache HTTP server. Performance measurements show that POLUS incurs negligible runtime overhead on the three applications-a less than 1 percent performance degradation (but 5 percent for one case). The time to apply an update is also minimal.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.79","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5551162","Maintainability;reliability;runtime environments.","Software;Synchronization;Protocols;Bidirectional control;Registers;Runtime","computer architecture;hypermedia;multi-threading;program testing;software maintenance;software tools;transport protocols","dynamic software update;relaxed consistency model;data structure;binary compatibility;nonnegligible performance;POLUS;software maintenance tool;iteratively evolving running unmodified multithreaded software;concurrent activity;cache-coherence protocol;computer architecture;bidirectional write-through synchronization protocol;prevalent server application;HTTP server","","27","4","42","","19 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, many programs claim they accept inputs with a published format, but their implementations actually support a subset or a variant. Based on the observations that input structure is manifested by the way input symbols are used during execution and most programs take input with top-down or bottom-up grammars, we devise two dynamic analyses, one for each grammar category. Our evaluation on a set of real-world programs shows that our technique is able to precisely reverse engineer input syntactic structure from execution. We apply our technique to hierarchical delta debugging (HDD) and network protocol reverse engineering. Our technique enables the complete automation of HDD, in which programmers were originally required to provide input grammars, and improves the runtime performance of HDD.

OBJECTIVE-This paper aims to identify and characterize evaluation strategies and measurements used to assess the impact of different SPI initiatives. METHOD-The systematic literature review includes 148 papers published between 1991 and 2008. The selected papers were classified according to SPI initiative, applied evaluation strategies, and measurement perspectives. Potential confounding factors interfering with the evaluation of the improvement effort were assessed. RESULTS-Seven distinct evaluation strategies were identified, wherein the most common one, “Pre-Post Comparison,” was applied in 49 percent of the inspected papers. Quality was the most measured attribute (62 percent), followed by Cost (41 percent), and Schedule (18 percent). Looking at measurement perspectives, “Project” represents the majority with 66 percent. CONCLUSION-The evaluation validity of SPI initiatives is challenged by the scarce consideration of potential confounding factors, particularly given that “Pre-Post Comparison” was identified as the most common evaluation strategy, and the inaccurate descriptions of the evaluation context. Measurements to assess the short and mid-term impact of SPI initiatives prevail, whereas long-term measurements in terms of customer satisfaction and return on investment tend to be less used.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.26","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5728832","Process implementation and change;process measurement;metrics/measurement;systematic literature review.","Software;Software measurement;Systematics;Current measurement;Data mining;Organizations","software process improvement","software process improvement;SPI;software development organization;customer satisfaction;return on investment","","117","","266","","10 Mar 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study addresses this issue by reporting on the results of a large scale benchmarking study. Different types of techniques are under consideration, including techniques inducing tree/rule-based models like M5 and CART, linear models such as various types of linear regression, nonlinear models (MARS, multilayered perceptron neural networks, radial basis function networks, and least squares support vector machines), and estimation techniques that do not explicitly induce a model (e.g., a case-based reasoning approach). Furthermore, the aspect of feature subset selection by using a generic backward input selection wrapper is investigated. The results are subjected to rigorous statistical testing and indicate that ordinary least squares regression in combination with a logarithmic transformation performs best. Another key finding is that by selecting a subset of highly predictive attributes such as project size, development, and environment related attributes, typically a significant increase in estimation accuracy can be obtained.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.55","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5928350","Data mining;software effort estimation;regression.","Software;Estimation;Data models;Data mining;Cognition;Artificial neural networks;Regression tree analysis","data mining;program testing;regression analysis;software cost estimation","data mining techniques;software effort estimation;predictive model;rule-based models;CART;M5;linear regression;nonlinear models;estimation techniques;feature subset selection;generic backward input selection wrapper;rigorous statistical testing;ordinary least squares regression;logarithmic transformation","","110","1","108","","23 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These pointcuts allow programmers to monitor program events where locks are granted or handed back, and where values are accessed that may be shared among multiple Java threads. We decide thread locality using a static thread-local-objects analysis developed by others. Using the three new primitive pointcuts, researchers can directly implement efficient monitoring algorithms to detect concurrent-programming errors online. As an example, we describe a new algorithm which we call RACER, an adaption of the well-known ERASER algorithm to the memory model of Java. We implemented the new pointcuts as an extension to the AspectBench Compiler, implemented the RACER algorithm using this language extension, and then applied the algorithm to the NASA K9 Rover Executive and two smaller programs. Our experiments demonstrate that our implementation is effective in finding subtle data races. In the Rover Executive, RACER finds 12 data races, with no false warnings.

QoS does not include only common attributes such as availability or response time but also attributes specific to certain business domains and processes. Therefore, we combine both domain-agnostic and domain-specific QoS attributes in an adaptive QoS model. For specifying the service selection strategy, we propose a domain-specific language called VieDASSL to specify so-called selectors. This language can be used to specify selector implementations based on the available QoS attributes. Both the QoS model implementation and the selectors can be adapted at runtime to deal with changing business and QoS requirements. Our approach is implemented on top of an existing WS-BPEL engine.

We have designed a framework for finding these correspondences automatically based on Bayesian methods. We represent models and diagrams as graphs whose nodes have attributes such as name, type, connections to other nodes, and containment relations, and we have developed probabilistic models for rating the quality of candidate correspondences based on various features of the nodes in the graphs.

In this paper, we review and analyze the debate about random testing. Its benefits and drawbacks are discussed. Novel results addressing general questions about random testing are also presented, such as how long does random testing need, on average, to achieve testing targets (e.g., coverage), how does it scale, and how likely is it to yield similar results if we rerun it on the same testing problem (predictability). Due to its simplicity that makes the mathematical analysis of random testing tractable, we provide precise and rigorous answers to these questions. Results show that there are practical situations in which random testing is a viable option. Our theorems are backed up by simulations and we show how they can be applied to most types of software and testing criteria.

Since SBST techniques are heuristic by nature, they must be empirically investigated in terms of how costly and effective they are at reaching their test objectives and whether they scale up to realistic development artifacts. However, approaches to empirically study SBST techniques have shown wide variation in the literature. This paper presents the results of a systematic, comprehensive review that aims at characterizing how empirical studies have been designed to investigate SBST cost-effectiveness and what empirical evidence is available in the literature regarding SBST cost-effectiveness and scalability. We also provide a framework that drives the data collection process of this systematic review and can be the starting point of guidelines on how SBST techniques can be empirically assessed.

This not only makes them fundamentally different from traditional web applications, but also more error-prone and harder to test. We propose a method for testing Ajax applications automatically, based on a crawler to infer a state-flow graph for all (client-side) user interface states.

Our approach, called Atusa, is implemented in a tool offering generic invariant checking components, a plugin-mechanism to add application-specific state validators, and generation of a test suite covering the paths obtained during crawling.

To speed up product line extraction, this paper describes a semi-automatic approach to annotate the code of optional features in SPLs. The proposed approach is based on an existing tool for product line development, called CIDE, that enhances standard IDEs with the ability to associate background colors with the lines of code that implement a feature.

In this paper, we describe a methodology for grammar recovery from a hard-coded parser. Our methodology is comprised of manual instrumentation of the parser, a technique for automatic grammar recovery from parse trees, and a semi-automatic metrics-guided approach to refactoring an iterative grammar to obtain a recursive grammar. We present the results of a case study in which we recover and refactor a grammar from version 4.0.0 of the GNU C++ parser and then refactor the recovered grammar using our metrics-guided approach.

Incomplete or faulty designs can cause security mechanisms to be incorrectly incorporated in a system, allowing them to be bypassed and resulting in a security breach. We advocate the use of the Aspect-Oriented Risk-Driven Development (AORDD) methodology for developing secure systems. This methodology begins with designers defining system assets, identifying potential attacks against them, and evaluating system risks. When a risk is unacceptable, designers must mitigate the associated threat by incorporating security mechanisms methodically into the system design. Designers next formally evaluate the resulting design to ensure that the threat has been mitigated, while still allowing development to meet other project constraints. In this paper, we focus on the AORDD analysis, which consists of: (1) a formal security evaluation and (2) a trade-off analysis that enables system designers to position alternative security solutions against each other. The formal security evaluation uses the Alloy Analyzer to provide assurance that an incorporated security mechanism performs as expected and makes the system resilient to previously identified attacks. The trade-off analysis uses a Bayesian Belief Network topology to allow equally effective security mechanisms to be compared against system security requirements and other factors such as time-to-market and budget constraints.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.36","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5432225","Aspect-oriented modeling (AOM);Bayesian belief network (BBN);security analysis;trade-off analysis.","Unified modeling language;Protection;Standards development;ISO standards;Data security;Design methodology;Bayesian methods;Risk management;Computer security;Computer Society","aspect-oriented programming;belief networks;formal verification;security of data;Unified Modeling Language","trade-off analysis;security properties verification;UML system models;secure systems design;aspect-oriented risk-driven development;AORDD methodology;risk evaluation;formal security evaluation;Alloy Analyzer;Bayesian belief network topology;time-to-market;budget constraints","","19","","51","","18 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Over the past few years, many test case prioritization techniques have been proposed in the literature. Most of these techniques require data on dynamic execution in the form of code coverage information for test cases. However, the collection of dynamic code coverage information on test cases has several associated drawbacks including cost increases and reduction in prioritization precision. In this paper, we propose an approach to prioritizing test cases in the absence of coverage information that operates on Java programs tested under the JUnit framework-an increasingly popular class of systems. Our approach, JUnit test case Prioritization Techniques operating in the Absence of coverage information (JUPTA), analyzes the static call graphs of JUnit test cases and the program under test to estimate the ability of each test case to achieve code coverage, and then schedules the order of these test cases based on those estimates. To evaluate the effectiveness of JUPTA, we conducted an empirical study on 19 versions of four Java programs ranging from 2K-80K lines of code, and compared several variants of JUPTA with three control techniques, and several other existing dynamic coverage-based test case prioritization techniques, assessing the abilities of the techniques to increase the rate of fault detection of test suites. Our results show that the test suites constructed by JUPTA are more effective than those in random and untreated test orders in terms of fault-detection effectiveness. Although the test suites constructed by dynamic coverage-based techniques retain fault-detection effectiveness advantages, the fault-detection effectiveness of the test suites constructed by JUPTA is close to that of the test suites constructed by those techniques, and the fault-detection effectiveness of the test suites constructed by some of JUPTA's variants is better than that of the test suites constructed by several of those techniques.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.106","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6363461","Software testing;regression testing;test case prioritization;JUnit;call graph","Software testing;Regression analysis;Scheduling","Java;program testing;regression analysis;software fault tolerance","static approach;regression testing;test case prioritization techniques;dynamic code coverage information;Java programs;JUnit test case prioritization techniques operating in the absence of coverage information;JUPTA;static call graphs;fault-detection effectiveness;dynamic coverage-based techniques","","72","","44","","29 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Mutable Protection Domains: Adapting System Fault Isolation for Reliability and Efficiency","G. Parmer; R. West","The George Washington University, Washtington, DC; Boston University, Boston","IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","26 Jul 2012","2012","38","4","875","888","As software systems are becoming increasingly complex, the likelihood of faults and unexpected behaviors will naturally increase. Today, mobile devices to large-scale servers feature many millions of lines of code. Compile-time checks and offline verification methods are unlikely to capture all system states and control flow interactions of a running system. For this reason, many researchers have developed methods to contain faults at runtime by using software and hardware-based techniques to define protection domains. However, these approaches tend to impose isolation boundaries on software components that are static, and thus remain intact while the system is running. An unfortunate consequence of statically structured protection domains is that they may impose undue overhead on the communication between separate components. This paper proposes a new runtime technique that trades communication cost for fault isolation. We describe Mutable Protection Domains (MPDs) in the context of our Composite operating system. MPD dynamically adapts hardware isolation between interacting software components, depending on observed communication “hot-paths,” with the purpose of maximizing fault isolation where possible. In this sense, MPD naturally tends toward a system of maximal component isolation, while collapsing protection domains where costs are prohibitive. By increasing isolation for low-cost interacting components, MPD limits the scope of impact of future unexpected faults. We demonstrate the utility of MPD using a webserver, and identify different hot-paths for different workloads that dictate adaptations to system structure. Experiments show up to 40 percent improvement in throughput compared to a statically organized system, while maintaining high-fault isolation.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.61","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5928356","Component-based;operating systems;reliability;fault isolation;performance","Kernel;Reliability;Hardware;Servers;Switches","fault tolerant computing;mobile computing;object-oriented programming;operating systems (computers)","mutable protection domains;system fault isolation;software systems;mobile devices;large-scale servers;compile-time checks;offline verification methods;control flow interactions;hardware-based techniques;software -based techniques;software components;MPD;composite operating system;fault isolation;maximal component isolation;mobile computing","","4","","40","","23 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Correct component resolution is critical for reliable and secure software execution. However, programming mistakes may lead to unintended or even malicious components being resolved and loaded. In particular, dynamic loading can be hijacked by placing an arbitrary file with the specified name in a directory searched before resolving the target component. Although this issue has been known for quite some time, it was not considered serious because exploiting it requires access to the local file system on the vulnerable host. Recently, such vulnerabilities have started to receive considerable attention as their remote exploitation became realistic. It is now important to detect and fix these vulnerabilities. In this paper, we present the first automated technique to detect vulnerable and unsafe dynamic component loadings. Our analysis has two phases: 1) apply dynamic binary instrumentation to collect runtime information on component loading (online phase), and 2) analyze the collected information to detect vulnerable component loadings (offline phase). For evaluation, we implemented our technique to detect vulnerable and unsafe component loadings in popular software on Microsoft Windows and Linux. Our evaluation results show that unsafe component loading is prevalent in software on both OS platforms, and it is more severe on Microsoft Windows. In particular, our tool detected more than 4,000 unsafe component loadings in our evaluation, and some can lead to remote code execution on Microsoft Windows.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.108","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6065738","Unsafe component loading;dynamic analysis.","Loading;Instruments;Image resolution;Operating systems;Linux;Security","Linux;object-oriented programming;operating systems (computers);security of data;software libraries;software reliability;system monitoring","automatic detection;unsafe dynamic component loadings;dynamic loading;software components;software libraries;software modules;system modularity;system flexibility;component resolution;software execution;malicious components;arbitrary file;file system;vulnerable host;remote exploitation;automated technique;vulnerable dynamic component loadings;dynamic binary instrumentation;runtime information;vulnerable component loadings;Microsoft Windows;Linux;unsafe component loading;OS platforms;remote code execution","","2","1","50","","1 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we address this problem by taking advantage of formal specification and analysis to support a systematic and rigorous inspection method. The aim of the method is to use inspection to determine whether every functional scenario defined in the specification is implemented correctly by a set of program paths and whether every program path of the program contributes to the implementation of some functional scenario in the specification. The method is comprised of five steps: deriving functional scenarios from the specification, deriving paths from the program, linking scenarios to paths, analyzing paths against the corresponding scenarios, and producing an inspection report, and allows for a systematic and automatic generation of a checklist for inspection. We present an example to show how the method can be used, and describe an experiment to evaluate its performance by comparing it to perspective-based reading (PBR). The result shows that our method may be more effective in detecting function-related defects than PBR but slightly less effective in detecting implementation-related defects. We also describe a prototype tool to demonstrate the supportability of the method, and draw some conclusions about our work.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6035726","Specification-based program inspection;software inspection;formal specification;program verification","DH-HEMTs;High definition video;Three dimensional displays","formal specification;formal verification","formal specification based inspection;program verification;software inspection;defect detection;automatic generation;systematic generation;perspective based reading;PBR;prototype tool","","21","","80","","6 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

What is evident nowadays, instead, is that architectural languages are defined by stakeholder concerns. Capturing all such concerns within a single, narrowly focused notation is impossible. At the same time, it is also impractical to define and use a ""universal"" notation, such as UML. As a result, many domain-specific notations for architectural modeling have been proposed, each one focusing on a specific application domain, analysis type, or modeling environment. As a drawback, a proliferation of languages exists, each one with its own specific notation, tools, and domain specificity. No effective interoperability is possible to date. Therefore, if a software architect has to model a concern not supported by his own language/tool, he has to manually transform (and, eventually, keep aligned) the available architectural specification into the required language/tool. This paper presents DUALLy, an automated framework that allows architectural languages and tools interoperability. Given a number of architectural languages and tools, they can all interoperate thanks to automated model transformation techniques. DUALLy is implemented as an Eclipse plugin. Putting it in practice, we apply the DUALLy approach to the Darwin/FSP ADL and to a UML2.0 profile for software architectures. By making use of an industrial complex system, we transform a UML software architecture specification in Darwin/FSP, make some verifications by using LTSA, and reflect changes required by the verifications back to the UML specification.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2009.51","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5204094","Software architectures;interoperability;domain-specific architectures;design tools and techniques;model transformations.","Software architecture;Unified modeling language;Computer architecture;Application software;Software tools;Computer industry;Architecture description languages;LAN interconnection;Domain specific languages;Software systems","open systems;software architecture;Unified Modeling Language","architectural languages;tools interoperability;automated model transformation techniques;Eclipse plugin;UML2.0 profile;DUALLy approach;Darwin-FSP ADL;industrial complex system;UML software architecture specification","","49","","35","","18 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our solution is based on a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) and uses class coupling and cohesion measurement for defining fitness functions. Our MOGA takes as input a class diagram to be optimized and suggests possible improvements to it. The choice of a MOGA stems from the fact that there are typically many evaluation criteria that cannot be easily combined into one objective, and several alternative solutions are acceptable for a given OO domain model. Using a carefully selected case study, this paper investigates the application of our proposed MOGA to the class responsibility assignment problem, in the context of object-oriented analysis and domain class models.

The research on the NRP is restricted by the growing scale of requirements. In this paper, we propose a Backbone-based Multilevel Algorithm (BMA) to address the large scale NRP. In contrast to direct solving approaches, the BMA employs multilevel reductions to downgrade the problem scale and multilevel refinements to construct the final optimal set of customers. In both reductions and refinements, the backbone is built to fix the common part of the optimal customers. Since it is intractable to extract the backbone in practice, the approximate backbone is employed for the instance reduction while the soft backbone is proposed to augment the backbone application. In the experiments, to cope with the lack of open large requirements databases, we propose a method to extract instances from open bug repositories. Experimental results on 15 classic instances and 24 realistic instances demonstrate that the BMA can achieve better solutions on the large scale NRP instances than direct solving approaches.

The key idea underlying this work is ""the inevitability of uncertainty"": It is rarely possible to assert that a claim about safety or reliability is true with certainty. Much of this uncertainty is epistemic in nature, so it seems inevitable that expert judgment will continue to play an important role in dependability cases. Here, we consider a simple case where an expert makes a claim about the probability of failure on demand (pfd) of a subsystem of a wider system and is able to express his confidence about that claim probabilistically. An important, but difficult, problem then is how such subsystem (claim, confidence) pairs can be propagated through a dependability case for a wider system, of which the subsystems are components. An informal way forward is to justify, at high confidence, a strong claim, and then, conservatively, only claim something much weaker: ""I'm 99 percent confident that the pfd is less than 10-5, so it's reasonable to be 100 percent confident that it is less than 10-3."" These conservative pfds of subsystems can then be propagated simply through the dependability case of the wider system. In this paper, we provide formal support for such reasoning.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.67","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5492693","Bayesian probability;safety case;software reliability.","Uncertainty;Software reliability;Phase frequency detector;Battery powered vehicles;Software systems;Software safety;Programming;Power engineering computing;Reliability engineering;Power engineering and energy","probability;software fault tolerance;uncertainty handling","software-based system dependability;software-based system safety;software-based system reliability;probability of failure on demand;conservative claims;formal support","","22","","24","","28 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

After a programmer enters a natural-language query that contains high-level concepts (e.g., MIME, datasets), Exemplar retrieves applications that implement these concepts. Exemplar ranks applications in three ways. First, we consider the descriptions of applications. Second, we examine the Application Programming Interface (API) calls used by applications. Third, we analyze the dataflow among those API calls. We performed two case studies (with professional and student developers) to evaluate how these three rankings contribute to the quality of the search results from Exemplar.

This communication is managed by the part of the application known as the protocol-handling layer, which enables the manipulation of protocol messages. The protocol-handling layer is a critical component of a network application since it represents the interface between the application and the outside world. It must thus satisfy two constraints: It must be efficient to be able to treat a large number of messages and it must be robust to face various attacks targeting the application itself or the underlying platform. Despite these constraints, the development process of this layer still remains rudimentary and requires a high level of expertise. It includes translating the protocol specification written in a high-level formalism such as ABNF toward low-level code such as C. The gap between these abstraction levels can entail many errors. This paper proposes a new language-based approach to developing protocol-handling layers, to improve their robustness without compromising their performance. Our approach is based on the use of a domain-specific language, Zebu, to specify the protocol-handling layer of network applications that use textual HTTP-like application protocols. The Zebu syntax is very close to that of ABNF, facilitating the adoption of Zebu by domain experts. By annotating the original ABNF specification of a protocol, the Zebu user can dedicate the protocol-handling layer to the needs of a given application. The Zebu compiler first checks the annotated specification for inconsistencies, and then generates a protocol-handling layer according to the annotations. This protocol-handling layer is made up of a set of data structures that represent a message, a parser that fills in these data structures, and various stub functions to access these data structures or drive the parsing of a message.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.64","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5487528","Network protocols;message parsing;message composing;domain-specific languages.","Electronic mail;Data structures;Robustness;Domain specific languages;Access protocols;Streaming media;IP networks;Network servers;Web server;Computer bugs","computational linguistics;formal specification;Internet;program compilers;protocols;specification languages;telecommunication computing","Zebu syntax;language-based approach;network protocol message processing;protocol-handling layer;protocol specification;ABNF;textual HTTP-like application protocols;Zebu compiler;data structures;message parsing;Internet era;domain-specific languages","","9","2","34","","17 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, making sense of the many, and sometimes seemingly inconsistent, results is difficult. OBJECTIVE - We propose and evaluate a general framework for software defect prediction that supports 1) unbiased and 2) comprehensive comparison between competing prediction systems. METHOD - The framework is comprised of 1) scheme evaluation and 2) defect prediction components. The scheme evaluation analyzes the prediction performance of competing learning schemes for given historical data sets. The defect predictor builds models according to the evaluated learning scheme and predicts software defects with new data according to the constructed model. In order to demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework, we use both simulation and publicly available software defect data sets. RESULTS - The results show that we should choose different learning schemes for different data sets (i.e., no scheme dominates), that small details in conducting how evaluations are conducted can completely reverse findings, and last, that our proposed framework is more effective and less prone to bias than previous approaches. CONCLUSIONS - Failure to properly or fully evaluate a learning scheme can be misleading; however, these problems may be overcome by our proposed framework.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.90","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5611551","Software defect prediction;software defect-proneness prediction;machine learning;scheme evaluation.","Software;Training data;Predictive models;Buildings;Data models;Prediction algorithms;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);software fault tolerance;software performance evaluation","software defect proneness prediction framework;scheme evaluation;competing learning schemes;defect predictor","","160","1","44","","28 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Software product lines are hence becoming a common trend in software development to reduce cost by enabling systematic, large-scale reuse. However, high levels of configurability entail new challenges. Some faults might be revealed only if a particular combination of features is selected in the delivered products. But testing all combinations is usually not feasible in practice, due to their extremely large numbers. Combinatorial testing is a technique to generate smaller test suites for which all combinations of t features are guaranteed to be tested. In this paper, we present several theorems describing the probability of random testing to detect interaction faults and compare the results to combinatorial testing when there are no constraints among the features that can be part of a product. For example, random testing becomes even more effective as the number of features increases and converges toward equal effectiveness with combinatorial testing. Given that combinatorial testing entails significant computational overhead in the presence of hundreds or thousands of features, the results suggest that there are realistic scenarios in which random testing may outperform combinatorial testing in large systems. Furthermore, in common situations where test budgets are constrained and unlike combinatorial testing, random testing can still provide minimum guarantees on the probability of fault detection at any interaction level. However, when constraints are present among features, then random testing can fare arbitrarily worse than combinatorial testing. As a result, in order to have a practical impact, future research should focus on better understanding the decision process to choose between random testing and combinatorial testing, and improve combinatorial testing in the presence of feature constraints.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2011.85","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5999671","Combinatorial testing;random testing;interaction testing;theory;constraint;feature diagram;lower bound","Software;Context;Fault detection;Feature extraction;Scalability;Benchmark testing","cost reduction;customer satisfaction;probability;program testing;program verification;random processes;software cost estimation;software fault tolerance","interaction fault detection probability;formal analysis;random testing;customer satisfaction;user satisfaction;software product lines;software development;cost reduction;large-scale reusability;combinatorial testing;computational overhead;feature constraints","","36","","37","","25 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hypotheses based on the distributed cognition and task interdependence theoretical frameworks were tested using data collected from a controlled lab experiment employing professional programmers. The results show a significant interaction effect between coupling, cohesion, and programmer team strategy on both maintenance effort and perceived ease-of-maintenance. Highly cohesive and low-coupled programs required lower maintenance effort and were perceived to be easier to maintain than the low-cohesive programs and high-coupled programs. Further, our results would predict that managers who strategically allocate maintenance tasks to either independent or collaborative programming teams depending on the structural complexity of software could lower their team's maintenance effort by as much as 70 percent over managers who use simple uniform resource allocation policies.

These techniques can assist system architects in evaluating the reliability impact of their design decisions. Architecture-based reliability engineering is only effective if the involved reliability models reflect the interaction and usage of software components and their deployment to potentially unreliable hardware. However, existing approaches either neglect individual impact factors on reliability or hard-code them into formal models, which limits their applicability in component-based development processes. This paper introduces a reliability modeling and prediction technique that considers the relevant architectural factors of software systems by explicitly modeling the system usage profile and execution environment and automatically deriving component usage profiles. The technique offers a UML-like modeling notation whose models are automatically transformed into a formal analytical model. Our work builds upon the Palladio Component Model (PCM), employing novel techniques of information propagation and reliability assessment. We validate our technique with sensitivity analyses and simulation in two case studies.

Ten to twenty years ago, many dynamic analyses investigated only simple method execution traces. Today, in contrast, many sophisticated dynamic analyses exist, for instance, for detecting memory leaks, analyzing ownership properties, measuring garbage collector performance, or supporting debugging tasks. These analyses depend on complex program instrumentations and analysis models, making it challenging to understand, compare, and reproduce the proposed approaches. While formal specifications and proofs are common in the field of static analysis, most dynamic analyses are specified using informal, textual descriptions. In this paper, we propose a formal framework using operational semantics that allows researchers to precisely specify their dynamic analysis. Our goal is to provide an accessible and reusable basis on which researchers who may not be familiar with rigorous specifications of dynamic analyses can build. By extending the provided semantics, one can concisely specify how runtime events are captured and how this data is transformed to populate the analysis model.

Many prioritization techniques have been proposed and evidence shows that they can be beneficial. It has been suggested, however, that the time constraints that can be imposed on regression testing by various software development processes can strongly affect the behavior of prioritization techniques. If this is correct, a better understanding of the effects of time constraints could lead to improved prioritization techniques and improved maintenance and testing processes. We therefore conducted a series of experiments to assess the effects of time constraints on the costs and benefits of prioritization techniques. Our first experiment manipulates time constraint levels and shows that time constraints do play a significant role in determining both the cost-effectiveness of prioritization and the relative cost-benefit trade-offs among techniques. Our second experiment replicates the first experiment, controlling for several threats to validity including numbers of faults present, and shows that the results generalize to this wider context. Our third experiment manipulates the number of faults present in programs to examine the effects of faultiness levels on prioritization and shows that faultiness level affects the relative cost-effectiveness of prioritization techniques. Taken together, these results have several implications for test engineers wishing to cost-effectively regression test their software systems. These include suggestions about when and when not to prioritize, what techniques to employ, and how differences in testing processes may relate to prioritization cost--effectiveness.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.58","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5482587","Regression testing;test case prioritization;cost-benefits;Bayesian networks;empirical studies.","Time factors;Software testing;Automatic testing;Maintenance engineering;Programming;System testing;Computer Society;Software systems;Bayesian methods;Software quality","belief networks;program testing;regression analysis;software fault tolerance","time constraints;test case prioritization techniques;regression testing;various software development processes;cost-benefit trade-offs;Bayesian networks","","82","","62","","7 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Better Debugging via Output Tracing and Callstack-Sensitive Slicing","S. Horwitz; B. Liblit; M. Polishchuk","University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison; University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison; Microsoft Corporation, Redmond","IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","29 Jan 2010","2010","36","1","7","19","Debugging often involves 1) finding the point of failure (the first statement that produces bad output) and 2) finding and fixing the actual bug. Print statements and debugger break points can help with step 1. Slicing the program back from values used at the point of failure can help with step 2. However, neither approach is ideal: Debuggers and print statements can be clumsy and time-consuming and backward slices can be almost as large as the original program. This paper addresses both problems. We present callstack-sensitive slicing, which reduces slice sizes by leveraging the series of calls active when a program fails. We also show how slice intersections may further reduce slice sizes. We then describe a set of tools that identifies points of failure for programs that produce bad output. Finally, we apply our point-of-failure tools to a suite of buggy programs and evaluate callstack-sensitive slicing and slice intersection as applied to debugging. Callstack-sensitive slicing is very effective: On average, a callstack-sensitive slice is about 0.31 time the size of the corresponding full slice, down to just 0.06 time in the best case. Slice intersection is less impressive, on average, but may sometimes prove useful in practice.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2009.66","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5282499","Static program slicing;callstack-sensitive analysis;points of failure;output tracing and attribution.","Debugging;Programming profession;Computer crashes;Failure analysis;Testing;Linux","program debugging;program slicing;software reliability","callstack-sensitive slicing;program debugging;program slicing;point-of-failure tools;buggy programs;slice intersection","","21","","38","","9 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

If so, security experts can use this prediction to prioritize security inspection and testing efforts. The metrics we investigated fall into three categories: complexity, code churn, and developer activity metrics. We performed two empirical case studies on large, widely used open-source projects: the Mozilla Firefox web browser and the Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel. The results indicate that 24 of the 28 metrics collected are discriminative of vulnerabilities for both projects. The models using all three types of metrics together predicted over 80 percent of the known vulnerable files with less than 25 percent false positives for both projects.

In this paper, we use three size metrics, two of which are available during the high-level design phase, to examine the potentially confounding effect of class size on the associations between OO metrics and change-proneness. The OO metrics that are investigated include cohesion, coupling, and inheritance metrics. Our results, based on Eclipse, indicate that: 1) The confounding effect of class size on the associations between OO metrics and change-proneness, in general, exists, regardless of whichever size metric is used; 2) the confounding effect of class size generally leads to an overestimate of the associations between OO metrics and change-proneness; and 3) for many OO metrics, the confounding effect of class size completely accounts for their associations with change-proneness or results in a change of the direction of the associations.

Doing so entails answering the question: What mitigations should be planned and deployed throughout the life of a systems development project in order to control risk and maximize project value? We introduce an integrative economic optimization approach to solving this problem. The approach is integrative since it bridges two complementary research streams: one takes a traditional microlevel technical view on the software development endeavor alone, another takes a macrolevel business view on the entire life cycle of a systems project. Bridging these views requires recognizing explicitly that value-based risk management decisions pertaining to one level impact and can be impacted by decisions pertaining to the other level. The economic optimization orientation follows from reliance on real options theory in modeling risk management decisions within a dynamic stochastic optimization setting. Real options theory is well suited to formalizing the impacts of risk as well as the asymmetric and contingent economic benefits of mitigations, in a way that enables their optimal balancing. We also illustrate how the approach is applied in practice to a small realistic example.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2009.25","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4815277","Risk management;systems development;economics.","Risk management;Programming;Control systems;Bridges;Costs;Risk analysis;Research and development management;Stochastic processes;Information analysis;Information management","business data processing;dynamic programming;macroeconomics;project management;risk management;software prototyping;stochastic programming","integrative economic optimization approach;system development risk management;system development project life cycle;microlevel technical view;software development;macrolevel business view;value-based risk management decision;dynamic stochastic optimization setting;real option theory","","6","","43","","17 Apr 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This assumption, however, may not hold true when the specification is complex and contains many specification components. For such a specification, the tester may construct a preliminary choice relation table from each specification component, and then consolidate all the preliminary tables into a final table to be processed by choc'late for test case generation. However, it is often difficult to merge these preliminary tables because such merging may give rise to inconsistencies among choice relations or overlaps among choices. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a DividE-and-conquer methodology for identifying categorieS, choiceS, and choicE Relations for Test case generation, abbreviated as dessert.

When one tries to identify the hierarchical composition of a program behavior at different abstraction levels, textual descriptions are not informative and expressive enough. To address this, we present a semi-automatic graph grammar approach to retrieving the hierarchical structure of the program behavior. The hierarchical structure is built on recurring substructures in a bottom-up fashion. We formulate the behavior discovery and verification problem as a graph grammar induction and parsing problem, i.e., automatically iteratively mining qualified patterns and then constructing graph rewriting rules. Furthermore, using the induced grammar to parse the behavioral structure of a new program could verify if the program has the same behavioral properties specified by the grammar.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5383371","Visual language;graph grammar induction;program comprehension;reengineering.","Software maintenance;Reverse engineering;Learning automata;Software systems;Data mining;Clustering algorithms;Pattern analysis;Algorithm design and analysis;Text mining;Documentation","data mining;graph grammars;program verification","program behavior discovery;program behavior verification;program comprehension;text mining algorithms;behavior patterns;formal models;program execution;semi-automatic graph grammar approach;graph rewriting rules;mining qualified patterns","","17","","60","","15 Jan 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hence, the need for metrics is more pressing now due to a growing demand for secure software. In this paper, we propose using a software system's attack surface measurement as an indicator of the system's security. We formalize the notion of a system's attack surface and introduce an attack surface metric to measure the attack surface in a systematic manner. Our measurement method is agnostic to a software system's implementation language and is applicable to systems of all sizes; we demonstrate our method by measuring the attack surfaces of small desktop applications and large enterprise systems implemented in C and Java. We conducted three exploratory empirical studies to validate our method. Software developers can mitigate their software's security risk by measuring and reducing their software's attack surfaces. Our attack surface reduction approach complements the software industry's traditional code quality improvement approach for security risk mitigation and is useful in multiple phases of the software development lifecycle.

Checking the consistency of such corresponding models is a major challenge for process modeling theory and practice. In this paper, we take the inappropriateness of existing strict notions of behavioral equivalence as a starting point. Our contribution is a concept called behavioral profile that captures the essential behavioral constraints of a process model. We show that these profiles can be computed efficiently, i.e., in cubic time for sound free-choice Petri nets w.r.t. their number of places and transitions. We use behavioral profiles for the definition of a formal notion of consistency which is less sensitive to model projections than common criteria of behavioral equivalence and allows for quantifying deviation in a metric way. The derivation of behavioral profiles and the calculation of a degree of consistency have been implemented to demonstrate the applicability of our approach.

Process modeling typically focuses on the normative process, that is, how the collaboration transpires when everything goes as desired. Unfortunately, real-world processes rarely proceed that smoothly. A more complete analysis of a process requires that the process model also include details about what to do when exceptional situations arise. We have found that, in many cases, there are abstract patterns that capture the relationship between exception handling tasks and the normative process. Just as object-oriented design patterns facilitate the development, documentation, and maintenance of object-oriented programs, we believe that process patterns can facilitate the development, documentation, and maintenance of process models. In this paper, we focus on the exception handling patterns that we have observed over many years of process modeling. We describe these patterns using three process modeling notations: UML 2.0 Activity Diagrams, BPMN, and Little-JIL. We present both the abstract structure of the pattern as well as examples of the pattern in use. We also provide some preliminary statistical survey data to support the claim that these patterns are found commonly in actual use and discuss the relative merits of the three notations with respect to their ability to represent these patterns.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5383369","Exception handling patterns;process modeling;process modeling languages.","Object oriented modeling;Documentation;Humans;Pattern analysis;Collaborative work;Unified modeling language;Collaboration;Data processing;Manufacturing processes;Medical services","exception handling;groupware;object-oriented programming;software maintenance;system documentation","exception handling patterns;process modeling;collaboration process;normative process;object-oriented design patterns;object-oriented programs;process development;process documentation;process maintenance;UML 2.0 activity diagrams;BPMN;Little-JIL","","77","","51","","15 Jan 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"A Genetic Algorithm-Based Stress Test Requirements Generator Tool and Its Empirical Evaluation","V.

However, since evolutionary algorithms are heuristic, their performance can vary across multiple executions, which may affect robustness and scalability. To address this, we present the design and technical detail of a UML-driven, GA-based stress test requirements generation tool, together with its empirical analysis. The main goal is to analyze and improve the applicability, efficiency, and effectiveness and also to validate the design choices of the GA used in the tool. Findings of the empirical evaluation reveal that the tool is robust and reasonably scalable when it is executed on large-scale experimental design models. The study also reveals the main bottlenecks and limitations of the tools, e.g., there is a performance bottleneck when the system under test has a large number of sequence diagrams which could be triggered independently from each other. In addition, issues specific to stress testing, e.g., the impact of variations in task arrival pattern types, reveal that the tool generally generates effective test requirements, although the features of those test requirements might be different in different runs (e.g., different stress times from the test start time might be chosen). While the use of evolutionary algorithms to generate software test cases has been widely reported, the extent, depth, and detail of the empirical findings presented in this paper are novel and suggest that the proposed approach is effective and efficient in generating stress test requirements. It is hoped that the findings of this empirical study will help other SBSE researchers with the empirical evaluation of their own techniques and tools.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2010.5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5383373","Index Term—Search-based testing;genetic algorithms;stress testing;test tools;test automation;empirical analysis.","Stress;System testing;Robustness;Genetic algorithms;Telecommunication traffic;Real time systems;Evolutionary computation;Scalability;Large-scale systems;Design for experiments","distributed algorithms;genetic algorithms;program testing;real-time systems;Unified Modeling Language","genetic algorithm;UML;distributed real time system;empirical analysis;software test cases;stress test requirement generation","","18","1","32","","15 Jan 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The companies were allocated randomly to either the original requirement specification or a manipulated version of the original requirement specification. The manipulations were as follows: 1) reduced length of requirement specification with no change of content, 2) information about the low effort spent on the development of the old system to be replaced, 3) information about the client's unrealistic expectations about low cost, and 4) a restriction of a short development period with start up a few months ahead. We found that the effect sizes in the field settings were much smaller than those found for similar manipulations in laboratory settings. Our findings suggest that we should be careful about generalizing to field settings the effect sizes found in laboratory settings.

Through the study of three IT projects, we confirm that risk dependencies do exist in projects and can be identified and systematically managed.

However, there exists some disadvantages and the main flow is prematurity because of the decrease of swarm diversity. Therefore, an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm combined with immune clone selection algorithm is proposed in this paper.

The 3D reconstruction of porous media is quite significant to the study of mechanisms of fluid flow in porous media. Therefore, a method using a real 2D micro-CT image and MPS to reconstruct the 3D structures of porous media is proposed. A cross-section of porous media, with the resolution of 10 microns, obtained by micro-CT scanning is used as an original training image. By using MPS and extracted sample points from each former regenerated training image, each newly reconstructed image is taken as a new training image to reconstruct its next layer. Then, the stochastic 3D images of porous media are generated by stacking all the reconstructed layers successively. The permeabilities of the reconstructed images and the target image composed of real sandstone volume data were computed by using lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for comparison. The experimental results show that although the structures of porous media reconstructed through this method are stochastic, all the reconstructed results have the similar structures, which are close to those of real volume data obtained by micro-CT scanning, demonstrating better reconstructed results than what two-point geostatistics does.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5364457","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5364457","","Image reconstruction;Interpolation;Stochastic processes;Space technology;Fluid flow;Image resolution;Shape;Topology;Image generation;Geologic measurements","flow through porous media;image reconstruction;lattice Boltzmann methods;physics computing;solid modelling","2D micro-CT Image;multiple point geostatistic;training image;porous media 3D reconstruction;fluid flow;lattice Boltzmann method","","","1","9","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the basic algorithm, a stack structure is used to store the decomposition status of octree, and the codes are exported during the stack operation so the sort and compression of nodes is avoided. Secondly the depth buffer is further used to accelerate the basic algorithm. The result shows that the basic algorithm is a robust and relatively fast algorithm.

A key step in policy conflict detection is to compare the relationship between policies. Existing approaches to address the problem of policy comparison are mainly based on logical reasoning and Boolean function comparison. Such approaches are computationally expensive and don't scale well for large heterogeneous distributed environments. Consequently a lightweight and effective approach is needed to improve the efficiency of policy relationship evaluation. Considering that policy rule comparison is the basis of policy comparison, we introduce the concept of rule dissimilarity in this paper and apply fuzzy theory to analyzing and computing rule dissimilarity to address the rule relationship comparison firstly. Rule dissimilarity measure provides a lightweight approach to pre-compile a large amount of rules and only return the most similar rules for further policy relationship evaluation and policy conflict detection. Detailed algorithms are presented for the rule dissimilarly computation.

The underlying assumption is that by reusing such conceptual reference models the development of the solution artifacts can be executed in a better way with regard to efficiency and effectiveness. However, human decision making may follow much simpler rule-based heuristics, rather than computing all given features (in a given model), impairing the assumed benefit of reference models as being used in the predominant grammars. We explore the frugality of the design decision process under reuse in a first experiment. The preliminary results show tendencies that the reference models' grammars indeed may be of limited aid in model learning and design, however, due to the small sample size the hypothesis should be examined in a larger factorial experiment in subsequent research activities.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5363772","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5363772","","Ergonomics;Decision making;Humans;Process design;Knowledge representation;Problem-solving;Psychology;Context modeling;Availability;Design engineering","corporate modelling;decision making;decision theory","frugal decision heuristic;enterprise design;ergonomics;reference model;shared understanding;semantic interoperability;conceptual reference model;human decision making;rule based heuristic;design decision process;model learning;design decision process frugality","","","","15","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is a difficult problem to directly model the spatiotemporal variations of trajectories due to their high dimensionality and nonlinearity. In this paper, a novel tracking and trajectory recognition algorithm is proposed by combining a bi-directional deep neural network called ""Continuous Autoencoder"" into a probabilistic framework. First, the ""Continuous Autoencoder"" network embeds high-dimensional trajectories in a two-dimensional plane based on a peculiar training rule and learns a trajectory generative model by its inverse mapping. Then a set of plausible trajectories are generated by the trajectory generative model. In the tracking process, the target state at each time step is estimated by combining above plausible trajectory set with particle filter. The trajectory identity is inferred by evaluating the improved Hausdorff distance between the estimated trajectory up to now and the truncated reference trajectories. Furthermore, the trajectory recognition results can provide valuable information for the next tracking. The experiments on tracking and recognizing handwritten digits show that the proposed algorithm can not only robustly track and exactly recognize in background clutter and occlusion, but also realize the track before identification.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5366549","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5366549","","Trajectory;Handwriting recognition;Surveillance;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Bidirectional control;Neural networks;Inverse problems;Target tracking;Particle tracking;State estimation","computer vision;image motion analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;particle filtering (numerical methods);target tracking","tracking algorithm;recognition algorithm;continuous autoencoder network;motion trajectory;behavior recognition;visual surveillance;guidance;spatiotemporal variation;bidirectional deep neural network;learning;trajectory generative model;inverse mapping;target state estimation;plausible trajectory;particle filter;trajectory identity;Hausdorff distance;background clutter;occlusion;visual tracking;computer vision","","","","15","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A lot of cost estimation models were reported in the literature but many of these models became obsolete because of the rapid changes in technology. Earlier cost estimation models used the size of the ultimate software product as the primary factor which, in many cases, was difficult to estimate. For example, COCOMO model used the number of Delivered Source Instructions (DSI) which is hard to estimate for products developed using modern programming languages. On the other hand, models such as Function Point (FP) metrics were designed to consider functional requirements instead of lines of code. These models were applicable only to procedural paradigm, and are not directly applicable to software products developed using the object-oriented methodology. It is this idea that gave birth to the creation of Use Case Point (UCP) metrics, originally developed by Gustav Karner[1993]. UCP uses use cases as the primary factor; use case model is the first model developed in an object-oriented design process using UML. In this paper, the authors extended the original UCP model with additional information obtained from use case narratives.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5364515","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5364515","","Costs;Object oriented modeling;Unified modeling language;Application software;Computer science;Project management;Software development management;Computer languages;Process design;Software design","object-oriented methods;software cost estimation;software metrics;Unified Modeling Language","software cost estimation;extended use case point model;cost estimation model;delivered source instructions;function point metrics;object-oriented design process;Unified Modeling Language","","15","","14","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, the classification accuracy can be improved by highlighting representative features and dimming irrelevant features. We apply a feature weighted ensemble classification model to solve this problem. The model is built using a modified K-means clustering technique and classification is performed with K-nearest neighbor algorithm. Experiments show that the method can improve the accuracy of classification, especially when there are noise features in high-dimensional stream data.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5364407","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5364407","","Clustering algorithms;Streaming media;Testing;Data mining;Training data;Remote monitoring;Computer science;Decision trees;Statistics;Frequency","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering","stream data classification;feature weighted ensemble classification;K-means clustering technique;K-nearest neighbor algorithm","","3","","10","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present an efficient method of Web sequential pattern mining in the e-learning environment. Different from traditional mining methods, we categorize the user sessions into human user sessions, crawler sessions and resource-download user sessions. Then we filter out the non-human user sessions, leaving the human user sessions for sequential pattern mining. With the purpose of mining users' meaningful sequential patterns, we identify users' transactions from the user sessions, and do the sequential pattern mining based on transaction level. We present a method of transaction identification based on users' access path tree. It can find out all the transactions effectively.

It is an extended predication logic language in the Tarski's style through the notions of a model and satisfiability. The model is a generalized information system based on intuitionistic fuzzy sets. An intuitionistic fuzzy sets based truth degree function is proposed, where objects satisfying a formula at a given threshold is defined in term of the truth degree function.

As the most popular technique for object-oriented software cost estimation, use case points(UCP) method, however, has two major drawbacks: the uncertainty of the cost factors and the abrupt classification. To address these two issues, we propose the extended use case points (EUCP) method. With a probabilistic cost model constructed from integrating fuzzy set theory and Bayesian belief networks(BBNs) with the UCP method, EUCP provides a probability distribution of cost and a refined gradual classification, which mitigate the uncertainty of cost factors and improve the accuracy of classification. In this paper, we provides two case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of EUCP in the real life.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5364706","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5364706","","Uncertainty;Object oriented modeling;Fuzzy set theory;Probability distribution;Cost function;Risk management;Fuzzy sets;Educational institutions;Computer science;State estimation","Bayes methods;fuzzy set theory;object-oriented programming;probability;software cost estimation","use case points method;software cost estimation;software industry;object-oriented software;probabilistic cost model;fuzzy set theory;Bayesian belief networks","","18","","15","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the existing index schemes have defect of lowness in query hit rate which leads to Internet crowdedness. It is the key for this problem to reduce the redundant tuples in query results. A synthetical cipher index technology to eliminate redundant tuples is presented through considering numeric data and character data respectively. Firstly, according to the query requirement, users' data is concluded into two classifications: the data of various fuzzy querying and that of numeric comparison. Next, cipher indices are established respectively. For the former, a newly cipher index scheme is presented, which determine k character indices for each character composed attribute domain through a mapping function. For the later, an order preserving encryption scheme is used as a cipher index scheme. Meanwhile, the effectiveness and security are analyzed.

Many methods are proposed to provide mutual anonymity and most of them are path-based: an anonymous path should be constructed by source peer before transmission. Although those proposals perform well in providing mutual anonymity, the pre-constructed paths suffer from node churn and make anonymous transmission unreliable. In this paper, we propose Group Routing (GR), an approach which is based on Onion Routing, to provide reliability as well as mutual anonymity. In GR, every stage of the preconstructed path contains several nodes to be redundancies each others, and the messages are encrypted and split into several packages to be forward to destination in the path. Compared with previous approaches that focus on reliability of anonymous communication, GR takes advantage of higher reliability and anonymity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GR through theoretical analysis and simulations. The analytical and experimental results show GR is more efficient to other proposals.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5363125","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5363125","","Routing;Peer to peer computing;Proposals;Public key;Broadcasting;Privacy;Cryptography;Packaging;Analytical models;Relays","data privacy;peer-to-peer computing;security of data","group routing;reliable mutual anonymous;dynamic overlay;online privacy;P2P system;onion routing","","","","18","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Customer retention and customer acquisition are two supports which have great influences on the bottom line compared with the increase of market share, the reduction of unit costs, and other competitive tools. In order to solve this problem the paper addresses a prediction model based on principal component analysis (abbr. PCA) and least square support vector machine (abbr. LS-SVM). The procedure includes two steps. In the first step PCA is used to compress raw input data and extract features, which can implement de-correlation. In the second step samples are used to train LS-SVM and establish customer churn forecasting model. In this way, the two algorithms have combined, whose advantages have been made a full use.

Once the clusters are created, the manger (coordinators) of the clusters may be used to form a backbone for efficient routing and communication purposes. A set of clusters may also provide the underlying physical structure for multicast communication for a higher level group communication module which may effectively be used for fault tolerance and key management for security purposes. Graph representing method for clustering in MANETs and show that although there is a wide range of such algorithms. MANEts are advancing rapidly, both in research and more and more into our everyday lives. MANETs are a prime example of a new technology that has gained a lot of attention in the literature, and that is going to enhance the way we view and interact with the environment. These mobile ad hoc networks are modeled by communication graphs which give the communication links between some devices or nodes equipped with wireless transceivers or radios. Independent and dominating sets are prominently used in the efficient organization of large-scale MANETs. In a communication graph, an independent set consists of vertices that cannot communicate with one another directly. Such a set is commonly used in clustering strategies, e.g. to obtain a hierarchical view of the network. The algorithmic complexity clustering is known to be NP-Complete for simple undirected graphs. For the special family of graphs that represent MANETs, modeled as unit disk graphs, we introduce a two phase distributed polynomial time and message complexity approximation solution with O(k) worst case ratio over the optimal solution. The first phase constructs a spanning tree of the network and the second phase then partitions the spanning tree into sub trees with bounded diameters.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5363378","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5363378","","Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Clustering algorithms;Tree graphs;Routing;Spine;Multicast communication;Fault tolerance;Security;Multicast algorithms","ad hoc networks;computational complexity;graph theory;mobile radio;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network routing;transceivers;trees (mathematics)","mobile ad hoc networks;network management;network routing;multicast communication;graph representing method;wireless transceivers;clustering strategies;algorithmic complexity clustering;NP-complete;message complexity approximation;spanning tree","","","","25","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We make use of the connection between the approximating subdivision schemes and interpolating subdivision schemes to produce a blending subdivision scheme that integrates interpolating and approximating subdivision schemes in a simple and efficient way. The basic idea is to use the specific linear combination of the displacements of the new vertices which are derived from approximating subdivision scheme to produce associated interpolating displacements for the new vertices therefore generating a corresponding interpolating subdivision scheme. The most importance is that such methods are deduced in premise of keeping the continuity of the original approximating subdivision schemes. In addition, our method has much lower computational complexity compared with the exiting methods and can be easily extended to the case of surface subdivision schemes.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5364005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5364005","","Sun;Spline;Computational complexity;Information science;Educational technology;Laboratories;Topology;Force control;Arithmetic","approximation theory;computational complexity;curve fitting;interpolation","interpolating subdivision schemes;approximating subdivision schemes;blending subdivisions;specific linear combination;computational complexity;C2 curves","","1","","19","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Scheme design produces many attack schemes of the same target. During scheme evaluation, attack schemes are evaluated and the comparatively optimal one is selected as course of action (COA) based on certain criterions. In this study, a multiple criteria decision making model is proposed to evaluate CNO attack schemes. Attack effects, costs and risks of attack tasks and attack paths are considered and evaluated to select an optimal scheme. As a multiple criteria decision making method that combines both qualitative and quantitative analysis, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is introduced and applied in the model.

But in many test scenarios, the entire test suites cannot be fully run due to the limited budget. Therefore it is necessary to take the importance of interactions into account and prioritize these tests of the test suite. In the paper, we use the hybrid approach to build prioritized pairwise interaction test suites (PITS). It adopts a one-test-at-a-time strategy to construct final test suites. But to generate a single test it firstly generates a candidate test and then applies a specific metaheuristic search strategy to enhance this test. Here we experiment four different metaheuristic search strategies. In the experiments, we compare our approach to weighted density algorithm (WDA). Meanwhile, we also analyze the effectiveness of four different search strategies and the effectiveness of the increasing iterations.

Then the m-bit Bloom Filter array is probabilistically written into the IP header of the passing packet or deterministically accumulated with the marking information in the IP header of the marked packet. If the Bloom Filter array in the marking information is full, the marking information is probabilistically written into another packet with the same source address and same destination address. This scheme has several advantages low false positive rate; fewer packets to reconstruct the attack path; and low computation overhead and storage overhead at the router. It implements the local traceback fast under large-scale DDOS attack in high-speed Internet.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5363316","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5363316","","Large-scale systems;Computer crime;Internet;Information filtering;Information filters;Software;IP networks;Computer science;Data structures;Data compression","cryptography;file organisation;Internet","large-scale DDoS attack;high-speed Internet;m-bit bloom filter array;scheme maps k hash;router IP;IP header","","3","","22","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Second, without providing for full life-cycle tool support, no change to embedded production processes will ever succeed, and again desktop tools must be adapted to meet the new environment's constraints.

Because variability is a widely used risk measure in finance, this risk-pricing method relates risk factor variability to project cost variability.

A Web 2.0 knowledge repository system can reduce costs, improve quality, and lower the risks of ERP implementations.Through the case study, the key desired features for Web 2.0 knowledge repository system to support ERP implementations were defined. Epics was designed to fulfill these requirements and developed a prototype. Epics can be used by software vendors, ERP consulting firms, and ERP users. Human aspects play a critical role in ERP implementation. ERP implementation quality depends largely on how the implementation personnel's knowledge and past experiences are reused and communicated. Although knowledge reuse, collaboration, and communication are important for all software projects, they're particularly critical in ERP implementation owing to its unique challenges.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2009.171","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5287009","Web 2.0;ERP implementation;software engineering;software implementation;packaged software;enterprise resource planning;ERP","Collaboration;Enterprise resource planning;Collaborative software;Personnel;Software packages;Costs;Software prototyping;Prototypes;Humans","data mining;enterprise resource planning;groupware;Internet;software reusability;software tools","ERP implementation;community collaboration;enterprise software packages;software vendor;Web 2.0 knowledge repository system;Epics software;ERP consulting firms;ERP users;knowledge reuse;communication","","12","1","12","","16 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Now, banks find themselves having to catch up with rapid advancements in software development that call for new service-oriented computing paradigms. Unfortunately, this task is nontrivial and often requires huge projects that are costly, time consuming, and risky. The safe choice for a development methodology is a process framework such as the Rational Unified Process (RUP), which is customizable enough to fit any project. However, customizing RUP isn't trivial, so it's often used in its full-blown out-of-the-box form, which entails significant sacrifices of time, cost, and flexibility. The Agile Unified Process (AUP)-a hybrid approach designed by Scott Ambler combining RUP with agile methods to a successful project in the banking sector. The project achieved on-time delivery within budget, integrating heavy legacy back-end application systems with newly reengineered client user-interface applications on a modern service-oriented architecture (SOA) platform.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2009.156","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5232801","software engineering;enterprise systems;systems design and analysis;methodologies;process;project management","Banking;Service oriented architecture;Programming;Costs","banking;software architecture;software maintenance;software prototyping;user interfaces","agile unified process;banking sector;software development;rational unified process;client user-interface application;service-oriented architecture;SOA;monolithic systems;legacy systems","","4","","12","","4 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Computer infrastructure over that period has gone from punchcard mainframes to modern parallel clusters. Model implementations have become complex, brittle, and increasingly difficult to extend and maintain. Verification processes for model implementations rely almost exclusively on some combination of detailed analyses of output from full climate simulations and system-level regression tests. Besides being costly in terms of developer time and computing resources, these testing methodologies are limited in the types of defects they can detect, isolate, and diagnose. Mitigating these weaknesses of coarse-grained testing with finer-grained unit tests has been perceived as cumbersome and counterproductive. Recent advances in commercial software tools and methodologies have led to a renaissance of systematic fine-grained testing. This opens new possibilities for testing climate-modeling-software methodologies.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2011.117","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5999647","software engineering;program verification;testing strategies;testing and debugging","Atmospheric measurements;Meteorology;Software development;Computational modeling;Atmospheric modeling;Numerical models;Global warming","climatology;digital simulation;geophysics computing;program diagnostics;program testing;program verification","software testing;software verification;climate model development;atmospheric process;computer infrastructure;parallel clusters;verification process;climate simulation;system-level regression test;computing resources;defect detection;defect isolation;defect diagnosis","","21","","16","","25 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Most SPLE approaches, however, have focused on developing statically configured products using core assets. That is, all variations are instantiated before a product is delivered to the customers, making it difficult for them to make any changes to the product. However, various application areas are increasing the demand for dynamic product reconfiguration. A service-oriented product line (SOPL) is a DSPL application domain that's built on services and a service-oriented architecture. An example of an application area for an SOPL approach is a virtual office (VO).

Little's law defines throughput as a ratio of work in process and cycle time.

This article shares experiences regarding the role architecture plays in lean software management practices. Release plans that give as much emphasis to architecturally significant tasks as to feature-based high-priority functionality can achieve better outcomes by avoiding conditions that lead to wasted time and effort. The application of lean software development practices can improve with better practical guidance on how to manage architecture flow as well as feature flow.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2012.109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6226344","software engineering management;lean software management;flow management;release planning;software architecture;waste","Computer architecture;Product life cycle management;Programming;Productivity;Agile manufacturing;Software management;Software architecture","software architecture;software development management;workflow management software","flow management;software development;software architecture;work in process;cycle time;lean software management;release plan;feature-based high priority functionality","","16","","12","","26 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The SASSY (Self-architecting Software Systems) framework automatically generates candidate software architectures and selects the one that best serves stakeholder-defined, scenario-based quality-of-service (QoS) goals. This lets domain experts concentrate on functional and QoS requirements. SASSY reduces the effort of composing service-oriented systems by automatically generating the QoS-optimized architecture and rapidly reconfiguring it at runtime. Self-architecting occurs during initial system deployment and at runtime, thus making systems self-adaptive, self-healing, self-managing, and self-optimizing.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2011.22","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5696721","software architectures;QoS;quality of service;service-oriented systems;software engineering","Computer architecture;Quality of service;Service oriented architecture;Software systems;Adaptation model","quality of service;service-oriented architecture","SASSY;self-architecting software systems;self-architecting service-oriented systems;architectural decisions;quality-of-service trade-offs","","70","","13","","20 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Pragmatists argued for mixed strategies of testing and proving, the use of tailored reliability models and development environments, the use of a full set of metrics, and the synthesis of life-cycle models. But while seizing the middle ground appeared to be a practical way to cope with difficulties, it seemed unlikely to produce a revolution. If software technologists are nowadays devoting more effort to engaging in a pragmatic fashion with the complexity of their problems, it is to their credit.

Traditionally, software evolution took place after software development put a system in place. However, the pace of change in technology and competition has changed the nature of software evolution to a continuous process, in which there's no neat boundary between development and evolution. Many traditional software development assumptions and practices haven't recognized this changing nature and increasingly find themselves in deep trouble as a result. Minimizing development costs by adopting numerous off-the-shelf products often leads to unaffordable evolution costs as vendors ship new releases and stop supporting the old ones. Assuming that a single form of evolutionary development covers all situations often leads to unrealistic commitments and dead-end systems as situations change.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2010.103","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5484112","software evolution;software engineering;software change;development","Programming;Costs;Lead;Marine vehicles","software engineering","software evolution;software development;off-the-shelf software products;evolutionary development","","8","","14","","14 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Apps, like all software, need some degree of guidance, regulation, and measurement to ensure a user is receiving proper functionality and quality of service. This problem has existed in software engineering and software development from Day 1, and apps are no different. The void has led to a recent clamor for some way to vet apps and the app stores in which they will reside and be licensed. The guest editors of this special issue contend that this will be a huge problem for the mobile app market as it continues to grow; the articles they feature here attempt to address the challenges to come.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2012.104","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6265078","software engineering;mobile devices;mobile apps","Special issues and sections;Mobile communication;Computer applications;Smart phones;Handheld devices;Cloud computing;Software engineering","","","","6","","2","","10 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

This article presents the top ten issues according to the voting, discusses the range of themes across the complete set of suggestions, and poses several questions that need answering for this backlog to be processed.

Open source refers to software that we may freely use, modify, or distribute, provided we observe certain restrictions with respect to copyright and protection of its open source status. OSS is not freeware and generally has a copyright.

All of these changes are having concrete impacts on which skills are important—and which no longer so—for software testers.

Without a good sense of where the project is and how far it still has to go, it's just not possible to consistently manage people and resources well. And miscommunicating progress to stakeholders is among the surest ways to lose trust and buy-in. Even with the best of intentions and good processes in place, it's possible for projects to end up in serious trouble as a result of misassessing or miscomunicating progress. The paper mentions that optimism is a virtue in many cases, but there is a fine distinction between optimism and wishful thinking.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2011.80","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5929519","Software engineering;survey;professional development","","project management;software development management","project sense;people management;resource management;software development management","","","","","","23 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

"Perfectionists in a World of Finite Resources","F. Shull",Fraunhofer Center for Experimental Software,"IEEE Software","28 Feb 2011","2011","28","2","4","6","The metaphor of technical debt, originally coined by Ward Cunninghamhas helped me recently get a handle on this type of issue. Almost invariably in software projects, developers can be so focused on accomplishing the needed functionality that the software itself grows less understandable, more complex, and harder to modify. Since this system deterioration usually reflects a lack of activity spent in refactoring, documentation, and other aspects of the project infrastructure, we can view it as a kind of debt that developers owe the system. Ward Cunningham's metaphor helps make clear an important trade-off: although a little debt can speed up software development in the short run, this benefit is achieved at the cost of extra work in the future, as if paying interest on the debt. Technical debt gives us a frame work for thinking about the fact that not doing some good things today, no matter how valuable they seem on their own merits, allows us to invest in other good things. In short, there are always trade-offs in life.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2011.38","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5720703","technical debt;code decay;code smells;software maintainability;software engineering","","software maintenance","technical debt;software projects;system deterioration;software development;software refactoring","","2","","","","28 Feb 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Many new business models for software-intensive enterprises have arisen in the last decade, ranging from selling software as a service to off shoring and crowd sourcing. Governments and standards bodies have also intervened to influence business models for stimulating growth in the industry. The software business has also had ancillary effects including the creation of new sectors such as innovation management. The management of intellectual property rights has become a more critical issue as software is embedded in more and more products. The debate about whether the software business is fundamentally different from others will continue, even as the software business continues to transform itself.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2011.77","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5929525","software;business model;open source;service;embedded systems","Special issues and sections;Software;Business;Marketing and sales;Strategic planning;Enterprise resource planning;Modeling;Product development;Productivity","business data processing;cloud computing;industrial property;innovation management;software engineering","software business;business model;software intensive enterprise;innovation management;intellectual property right;software as a service","","1","","5","","23 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Erdogmus",Kalemun Research,"IEEE Software","19 Aug 2010","2010","27","5","2","7","Considered a gross misnomer by some, earned value for progress tracking in software development projects is still little known in the software industry. But the concept shouldn't be so unfamiliar: tracking progress by earned value is similar to tracking progress through burndown charts-the ubiquitous, simple and powerful visuals that are so popular in agile software development. The two techniques, although developed independently in very different contexts, are similar in terms of their information content. This isn't a new discovery: Alistair Cockburn talked about the relationship between earned value and burndown charts as early as 2004 in Chapter 3 of his book Crystal Clear (Addison-Wesley, 2004). Section 7.3 of Gngori Melnik's and Gerard Meszaros' volume 1 of Acceptance Test Engineering Guide also discusses the same relationship.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2010.130","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5551010","software engineering;project management;performance measurement;earned value;earned value management;burndown charts;schedule variance;cost variance","","DP industry;project management;software development management;software prototyping","progress tracking;software development projects;software industry;agile software development;burndown charts;earned value","","","","","","19 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Organizations adopting product development strategies that include a software product line have achieved impressive results, reducing product cycle time and increasing productivity by an order of magnitude. The software product line strategy is a blend of business and technical actions that lets an organization satisfy a wide range of customers, gain leverage with suppliers, meet the threats of substitute products, and deter other companies seeking to enter the market. The strategy is robust over a wide range of technologies, domains, and organizations of different structures, cultures, and goals. Service-oriented architectures, agile development methods, and open source business models have all played roles in successful product line organizations.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2010.74","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5452144","software architecture;software product lines;software engineering","Asset management;Software development management;Product development;Productivity;Companies;Robustness;Service oriented architecture","business data processing;product development;software architecture;software reusability","software product line strategy;software-intensive systems;market segment;product development strategies;product cycle time reduction;service-oriented architectures;agile development methods;open source business models","","22","","18","","19 Apr 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Kruchten",University of Helsinki; IT University of Copenhagen; University of British Columbia,"IEEE Software","25 Feb 2010","2010","27","2","16","22","Agile development has significantly impacted industrial software development practices. However, despite its wide popularity, there's an increasing perplexity about software architecture's role and importance in agile approaches. Advocates of architecture's vital role in achieving quality goals for large software-intensive systems doubt the scalability of any development approach that doesn't pay sufficient attention to architecture. This article talks about software architecture being relevant to the basis of aspects such as communication among team members, inputs to subsequent design decisions, documenting design assumptions, and evaluating design alternatives. In a large software organization, implementing agile approaches isn't a straightforward adoption problem. Most likely, it will take several years to shorten the feedback cycles to benefit from the adaptability and earlier value-creation opportunities. Failure is a natural part of process improvement.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2010.36","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5420791","software architecture;agile development methods;software engineering","Computer architecture;Software architecture;Computer industry;Programming;Scalability;Feedback","software architecture;software development management","agile development;industrial software development practices;software intensive systems;software architecture;design decisions;design assumptions","","79","","32","","25 Feb 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
